<h1>The RIF redevelopment</h1>

</p>

<p>
The RIF is embedded within geographical information systems (GIS) software. It is 
being redeveloped in 2012-2015 to update software coding and improve functionality. 
</p>

<p>
The new RIF will use more modern technologies that are better able to mix proprietary 
and open-source software products. The new application will be written in Java, Javascript 
and HTML5 some of the most popular internet programming languages (the original software 
was written in Visual Basic). It will also make use of open source products such as 
PostgreSQL as a database and PostGIS as the geographic information system with plans 
to extend statistical capababilities by a new linkage with the statistical package R 
(via the PL/R Postgres database language extension). Existing RIF statistical 
functionality such as Satscan (for cluster dectection), INLA and LinBUGS/WinBUGS 
(for Bayesian Smoothing) will continue to be supported.
</p>

<p>
New technical features will include enhancement of flexibility by clearly defined XML 
interfaces, giving the RIF a batch mode for the first time and allowing for the export of 
the data into other tools. Statistical processing will be built in modular manner so it 
can be easily extended. Additionally, there are plans to integrate RIF risk analysis with 
the BREEZE AERMOD / ISC new generation air quality modelling system 
(http://www.breeze-software.com/aermod/). It is also hoped to support Wind roses.
</p>

<p>
The new RIF will be released under lesser GPL open source license to allow for close 
collaboration with all the stakeholders.
</p>

<p>
IT Administrators will appreciate the ability to generate an audit trail that will be 
created alongside result sets. The audit record will include the original query submission, 
the warning and error messages generated by running the query and summary statistics about 
the number of results that were returned by the database.
</p>

<p>
The development will also focus on optimising RIF performance on very large datasets to 
allow the RIF to be used on larger studies than at present. The new RIF will also be 
designed as a multi user application fully able to support the complex information 
governance requirements to keep research health databases secure.
