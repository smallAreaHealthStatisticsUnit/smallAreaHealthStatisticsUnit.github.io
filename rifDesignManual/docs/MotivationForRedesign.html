The Rapid Inquiry Facility is a software tool that has evolved in different incarnations 
over the past decade.  Although various technologies have been used throughout the years, 
the concepts and processes associated with running an environmental health study have remained 
stable.  The current context of development is best understood in relation to the way the previous 
version, RIF v3.0, was developed.
