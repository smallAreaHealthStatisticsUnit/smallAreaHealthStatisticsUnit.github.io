<h2>
Developing a tool suite rather than a single tool
</h2>
<p>
The first goal of RIF design is to divide a large, complex feature set in a way that best benefits 
the needs of different end users and which promotes division of labour on the development team.  
Whereas RIF v3.0 supported different types of users with a single application, RIF v4.0 will rely on a 
collection of related tools which target different user roles and tasks.  Developing specialised tools 
allows the user interface and learning materials of each tool to be streamlined for a specific audience.  
By separating the concerns of each type of user and by establishing how the tools would interact with 
one another, the design will provide project modules that promote a clean division of labour amongst 
the developers.
</p>

<p>
The most reasonable dividing line of features exists between those needed by the scientists and those 
needed by the RIF managers.  Epidemiologists, GIS scientists and statisticians may be interested in 
creating and running studies and visualising the results.  RIF managers need to be able to load geospatial 
and health data into the database.  They also need the ability to inspect either the study question or 
the study answer to determine whether the results are too sensitive to release or not.  Figure "General Design-1" 
shows a tool suite that supports these tasks:
</p>

<i><b>Fig. General Design-1</b>: Old vs new designs of the Rapid Inquiry Facility.  In the new version, the feature 
set is supported by four tools rather than one.</i>
</p>

<p>
Creating a study and viewing its results are related but different activities.  Creating a study focuses 
on data entry, whereas retrieving results focuses on maps, graphs and ways of visualising combinations of 
health and geographic information.  The administrative tasks of loading new data into the RIF database and 
evaluating the data protection implications of studies are another example of very different tasks being 
supported for the same role.
</p>

tool, a study result retrieval tool, a data loader tool and an information governance tool.

<h2>
Using a Three-Tiered Architecture
</h2>

<p>
Another way to divide the software project is by the computational theme of each task.  For any user 
feature, there is usually a common sequence of operations
<ol>
<li>
gather data from the users via electronic forms
</li>
<li>
perform some kind of business operation that makes use of the knowledge about business concepts
</li>
<li>
store or retrieve data from the database
</li>
<li>
render results of the operation
</li>
</ol>

<p>
These tasks roughly coincide with areas of expertise on the team.  Federico Fabbri has done extensive 
work designing web-based geospatial applications that support data entry and data visualisation of results.
Much of his work has related to creating front-end displays.  Peter Hambly has spent years developing the 
RIF database schema and Margaret Douglass has extensive experience writing database scripts that perform 
the kinds of data extraction tasks that the RIF is supposed to support. Both have experience in developing 
back end code.  I've spent years writing reusable software services and Nan Lin has had a background of 
testing complex scientific modeling code.  Both of us have developed code which can mediate communication
between front end displays and back end databases.  The computational themes and the skill sets invite us 
to use a common three-tiered architecture for design.


<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#gen_design2">
General Design-2
</a>
</b>: 
Organise code using a common three tier architecture that has the following layers: a presentation layer 
for managing GUI code; a business concept layer for managing the way business concepts are expressed 
in the system; and a data storage layer for managing the task of reading data from or writing data 
to the database.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>




<p>
In this design, the <b>presentation layer</b> contains all the code that is used to create electronic 
forms, graphs and reports.  It is concerned with supporting guided data entry features and restricting 
user actions to those which are necessary for supporting features.  In the tool suite, both the
Study Submission Tool and the Study Result Viewer Tool will be developed as web applications.  The
Data Loader Tool and the Information Governance Tool will be developed as desktop applications.  A
desktop version of the Study Submission Tool was developed to facilitate rapid prototyping and will
remain as a tutorial example for developers who want to build new client applications.  Web-based
front-ends will use JavaScript and HTML5, whereas desktop applications will be coded using Java Swing.
</p>

<p>
The <b>business concept layer</b> contains classes which describe the concepts that should be meaningful 
to scientists.  The code contains cardinality information that relates concepts with one another.  
The layer also contains validation code that checks for data type errors, out-of-bounds values and 
illegal combinations of field values.  The <b>data storage layer</b> contains the code that is used 
to generate SQL queries, manage database resources, and do validation checks for non-existent 
or duplicate items in the database. Both the business concept and data storage layers will be coded 
using Java.
</p>



<p>

<br>
<i><b>Fig. General Design-2</b>: Basic Three Tier Architecture.</i>
</p>

<p>
Interactions between layers should be strictly controlled so that they can maintain their separation 
of concerns.  Code in the presentation layer will typically extract field values from electronic forms to 
produce business objects. The business objects validate the form data as much as they can.  The objects 
are then used within the data storage layer to assemble SQL queries.  The queries are executed and the 
query results are assembled into business objects.  The objects are passed from the business concept 
layer to the presentation layer, where the results are rendered in electronic forms.  In this scenario, 
the business concept layer strictly mediates communication between the presentation and data storage 
layer.
</p>


<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#gen_design3">
General Design-3
</a>
</b>: 
Ensure that the presentation layer only interacts with the data storage layer via the business concept 
layer.  Never let presentation and data storage layer have direct communication with one another.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>


<h2>
Motivating the Development of Middleware
</h2>
<p>
The code base needs to support actions as well as business concepts that can be used by the presentation
layer.  In order to strictly enforce the access protocol between layers, the data storage layer should
be completely hidden and inaccessible to code in the presentation layer.  Therefore, the business concept 
layer needs to publish service APIs which describe methods that front end client applications can use.  
The input parameters and return values for these methods should be expressed in terms of business concepts 
and simple data types.
</p>

<p>
The service APIs effectively hide the rest of the code base from the presentation layer.  From the 
perspective of the front end applications, it should be irrelevant which classes are implementing
the interfaces, how database queries are exectued and which database is being used.  The set of 
services that mediate communcation between the databases and the front end applications together
constitute the middleware of the RIF project.
</p>

<p>
The middleware provides a centralised mechanism for handling requests from front end applications.
Using middleware, code used to support tasks such as validation, auditing, security checks and 
exception handling can also be centralised and be reused by all the client applications.
</p>

<p>
By limiting access to the code base to service APIs, the middleware reduces the number of execution 
paths that could be exercised during operation.   Controlling execution paths in this way helps
minimise potential problems relating to concurrency and malicious code attacks.  It also 
allows testing efforts to be economised because test cases don't have to be developed for pathways
that will never occur.
