<h1>RIF v4.0 and new design considerations</h1>

<p>
Whereas the emphasis of development in RIF v3.0 was end-user features for epidemiologists, the 
development of RIF v4.0 is driven by the needs of RIF managers, statisticians, and the need to support 
non-functional requirements of the software system such as better performance, security, accessibility, 
extensibility and maintainability.
</p>

<p>
Statisticians will be able to contribute statistical plugins that will post-process study results.  
For example, they may develop new ways of applying Bayesian smoothing to results.  RIF managers will 
have better features to help them load and maintain health and geospatial data.  As well, they will have 
features that allow them to support information governance tasks.  For example, the Information Governance 
Tool will alert them about whether any of the population cell counts fall below a threshold that could 
identify an individual.  
</p>

<p>
There are changes in the development environment as well.  Instead of having one 
dedicated developer, we have multiple developers who contribute to parts of the project at different times.  
Changes in funding have made it more difficult to dedicate any programmer to just one project full time.  
Our way of developing code has had to anticipate contributions from developers who have different strengths 
and use different technologies.  For example, one developer has skill in creating front-ends using JavaScript, 
whereas another developer has skill in making database scripts written for Oracle or PostgreSQL databases.
</p>

<p>
When ESRI deprecated support for Microsoft Visual Basic, we decided that we needed to invest in building 
a new RIF that would scale with larger data sets and would age well as technologies it depended on came and 
went.  As well, we wanted to design the tool suite in a way that would support a new generation of RIF 
developers.  Given that Imperial College was forced to bear the costs of rewriting the RIF software from 
scratch, we gave priority to ensuring that we could help minimise future maintenance costs.
</p>

<p>
In light of problems we encountered in the development of RIF v3.0, we have taken a number of measures to 
improve the design of the software. These may be regarded as factors that have significantly influenced design.
</p>

<h2>
<a name="#new_choose_open_source_tools">
Lower costs by using freely available open source tools that enjoy wide market share
</a>
</h2>

<p>
Our first major task was to think about which software technologies should be used to create RIF v4.0.  
We decided that the best candidate open source database was PostgreSQL.  It performed well with large 
data sets, and it had support for PostGIS, which is a library of geospatial operations.  
</p>

<p>
We decided to use Java to code any business logic that could not be handled by the database, and a 
combination of PHP and HTML5 for any web-based forms.  We also decided that any work involving web 
services would be supported using the Jersey project.
</p>

<p>
For Imperial College's implementation of the RIF, we would use a stack of tools which were all free, 
widely supported open source tools.  However, we needed to generalise the design of the software to 
accommodate needs of the CDC.
</p>

<h2>
<a name="anticipate_middleware">
Anticipate the development of middleware to offset requirements of multiple database vendors
</a>
</h2>
Our original plan was to build code for the back-end of the RIF using PostsgreSQL to process most of 
the database queries and PostGIS to process specialised geospatial operations.  However, it eventually 
became clear the CDC's implementation of the RIF would need to work with SQL Server. 
</p>

<p> 
Initially, we were going to write most of the queries relating to database operations in SQL procedures 
that would reside on the database server.  We reasoned that it made most sense to let code that was part 
of the database to support computationally intensive tasks that used database data.
</p>

<p>
However, it was not clear what feature set could be supported uniformly across both PostgreSQL and SQL 
Server.  Furthermore, SQL Server did not appear to come bundled with any technology that was comparable 
to PostGIS.  In the interest of preserving cross-vendor compatibility, it became clear that we had to 
migrate support for some database features out of stored database procedures and into Java code that was 
used to support business operations.  
</p>

<p>
The need to support two very different back ends forced our design to have a layer of middleware 
which could perform tasks that were not uniformly supported by either database vendor. 
</p>

<h2>
<a name="minimise_tool_dependencies">
Reduce impact of future obsolescence by minimising tool chain dependencies
</a>
</h2>

<p>
One of the most popular sentiments in software development is: "don't reinvent the wheel".  If 
someone else has written code to support a feature, there is a temptation to use the libraries 
to save work.  There is an even greater temptation to reuse software when it has been made available 
as an open source project.  However, adding software libraries can complicate matters of licensing 
and installation of software products.  As well, their use can raise the skill requirement of 
future developers and make the software applications more vulnerable to obsolescence.  Much 
publicity has been given to popular open source projects such as Linux, PostgreSQL, Eclipse, 
various Apache projects and MySQL.  These projects have large user bases and are maintained by a 
distributed but well organised collection of developers who evolve high quality products.  
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, there are enough developers who have an interest or stake in development such that 
some are likely to be actively scrutinising the code base.  However, in more typical open source 
projects, the quality and provenance of the code is poorly documented or not documented at all. 
Significant effort may be required to determine its fitness for purpose, and whether the cost of 
configuring and initially using it is less than developing code from scratch.  
</p>

<p>
Longer term maintenance costs must also be considered.  The ability for a library to avoid 
obsolescence will depend on how many people are in the developer community, how well they are funded, 
and how well the project is marketed relative to other projects that claim to support the same features.  
These concerns made us cautious about incorporating software libraries from new or little known open 
source projects. 
</p>

<p>
However, we have also had to be careful in considering how we use libraries from well-established 
open source projects.  Specifically, we have had to be concerned about how well they would integrate 
with one another. RIF v3.0 may have had more costly software dependencies than RIF v4.0, but they 
were more tightly integrated with one another as well.  The rich feature set of ArcGIS was maintained 
under the direction of a single organisation.  The code base was written using Microsoft Visual Basic, 
which was well supported by MS Access, another Microsoft product that guaranteed seamless integration 
between electronic forms and the database the supported them.
</p>

<p>
In RIF v4.0, the software uses a technology stack of open source tools which are maintained by 
different communities. Their use of interfaces developed through community standards should in theory 
ensure that one implementation of an open source library can be substituted for another.  However, 
there is still potential that there will be interoperability problems between the tools.  
</p>

<p>
There are three kinds of open source libraries we have had to consider for RIF v4.0:
<ul>
<li>
web application frameworks
</li>
<li>
object-relational mapping frameworks
</li>
<li>
libraries that are included in distributions by Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
</li>
</ul>


<p>
We didn't develop web applications using a web application framework because the team had 
already built complex geospatial web applications using JavaScript and HTML5.  Federico Fabbri had 
produced SAHSU's much lauded Environmental Health Atlas.  Many users of this application asked 
that similar features for mapping navigation be reused in the web-based versions of RIF tools.  
By using JavaScript, Federico was able to reuse code that had already been tested in a related project.

We also avoided using object-relational mapping frameworks because we were not sure how well they 
would support performance tuning queries that had to map to SQL Server, PostgreSQL and Oracle 
databases.  My own impression of ORMs is that they work best when
<ul>
<li>
there is a simple mapping between Java objects and relational table fields
</li>
<li>
the in-memory objects are mapped to a single database product
</li>
<li>
database queries use plain, standard SQL
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Mapping objects to relational tables is often a difficult task that must be continued as 
the data model for the software evolves.  Originally SAHSU thought it would only use PostgreSQL, 
but we later had to support SQL Server and support data wrappers that would allow PostgreSQL to 
delegate actions to Oracle.  As well, we are still determining how or if specialised geospatial 
features found in PostGIS can be supported by SQL Server.  The prospect of maintaining object 
relational mappings to non-standard queries suggested there may be risk in doing this through 
the frameworks.  
</p>

<p>
Deciding not to use web or ORM frameworks comes with its own cost.  The code base has a lot of 
repetitive patterned code that is used to marshal and un-marshal data between Java objects and 
database tables.  The extra code is specific to just the RIF software, and the code must continue 
to be maintained and tested.

<p>
Finally, we decided to avoid relying on software libraries that came bundled with IDEs such as 
NetBeans and Eclipse.  Originally we developed RIF code with NetBeans before switching to Eclipse.  
NetBeans had built-in wizards for generating web services.  However, those services seemed to become 
reliant on the libraries the IDE would include in the executable that was produced.   We felt it was 
not desirable to make the RIF implicitly dependent on libraries that were packaged specifically in 
relation to a particular development environment.  Therefore we now take care not to make the compiled 
code dependent on Eclipse-specific libraries either. 
</p>

<h2>
<a name="open_source_codebase">
Open source the code to prevent single-source development and recover value for research funds spent 
on development activities 
</a>
</h2>
Research grants are designed to fund research, not development projects.  
Software development can appear to funding bodies as being costly, long-running activities whose return 
on investment is not easily expressed in terms of publications or efficiency gains.  It is more common 
for funding bodies to value other metrics of use such as estimates of effort saved using a tool; monitoring 
the download count for an application; or observing how often a tool is cited in other publications.  
Another way to show value for a development project is to publish the code base.  In deciding whether to 
publish the code base we had to weigh the benefits of sharing knowledge about the product against the 
potential revenue that could come from protecting intellectual property of a closed code base.
</p>

<p>
The RIF has been developed in a publicly funded research institution and the users of the software will 
also likely be public funded research institutions.  The nature of routinely collected health data would 
suggest the most likely kind of group to have data permissions would be public health units in the UK.  
Neither the development team nor the anticipated clients function within a corporate, market-driven 
environment that would sustain the life of the product as a closed-source system.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, it is in the public interest that projects can scrutinise code which can produce results 
that influence public policy.  For example, if the finding of a study drew incorrect conclusions, project 
leaders should have the option of investigating the software as a potential source of error.
Perhaps the most compelling reason to publish the code base is to reduce the risk that the RIF project 
becomes critically reliant on single-source development.  Natural turnover of developer staff puts 
Imperial College at a risk of losing valuable institutional knowledge about a product it has spent a 
decade producing.
</p>

<p>
Open sourcing code doesn't guarantee that other developers will understand how the software works.  
However, I would contend that publishing code tends to encourage developers to make their work more 
readable for at least two reasons:
<ul>
<li>
their work advertises their skill
</li>
<li>
they may feel more compelled to justify design decisions in anticipation of peer review by the wider 
developer community
</li>
</ul>
Open sourcing the code encourages developers to be more transparent about their design process, and 
increases the likelihood that their work can be extended or reused by future developers. 


<h2>
<a name="deskill_codebase">
Design the code base so that it can be maintained by developers with minimal skill
</a>
</h2> 
Although the RIF project has been better funded than other scientific software projects, 
its future development will likely be characterised by a series of lone developers who may be 
domain scientists but who may not be experienced software developers.  This may not turn out to 
be the case - but it is best if we make this assumption.  


<p>
Making this assumption influences us in other ways:
<ul>
<li>
development should minimise the number of technologies it depends on
</li>
<li>
development should avoid making 'clever code'
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The more technologies that need to work together to make the RIF work, the broader the skill 
set that would be required of a single developer to maintain it.  The more advanced the coding 
work appears in the code base, the greater the depth of skill will be required of that same 
developer.  The greater the breadth and depth of experience required in the developer, the more 
the project will have to compete with commercial rates for hiring more experienced programmers.


<h2>
<a name="invest_in_upfront_design">
Invest in up-front design to lower future maintenance costs
</a>
</h2>
Every software project has to consider how much emphasis their project gives to up-front design.  
Developing a formally designed and documented architecture takes significant investment and the task 
of synchronising documentation about the design with the code is an ongoing maintenance cost.  


<p>
In projects where software requirements are volatile or not clearly defined, it can be desirable 
to avoid up front design in favour of focusing design on short term needs.  When new requirements 
emerge, the development process supports the idea of refactoring code and testing changes with an 
evolving set of automated test suites.  Instead of focusing on architectural design, projects in 
these environments will tend to rely on reusing a collection of smaller-scale design patterns that 
embody common coding scenarios.  
</p>

<p>
Rather than investing in development of an elaborate architecture and formalising high level 
abstractions through documentation, many of these teams choose to rely on pair programming and direct 
interactions amongst developers to share their knowledge.
</p>

<p>
The characteristics of our project are different.  Even after we reassessed what epidemiologists 
wanted RIF v4.0 to do, the requirements that emerged seemed largely consistent with those that 
had been articulated in the previous decade of tool development.  At least two of the developers 
had observed the RIF evolve from much earlier versions.  
</p>

<p>
Two members of the database team had spent years responding to ad hoc requests that are embodied by 
what the tools do.  Some of our requirements for doing risk analysis, advanced statistical analysis and 
information governance still need to be clarified.  However, most of our requirements have been 
predictable and are unlikely to change much in the short to medium term future.  This characteristic 
of having mature requirements suggests that high level designs will remain well synchronised with 
changes that occur in the code base.  In recent years, we have acquired more interest in the tool by 
other research groups who are located in different countries.  In future, we may receive more technical 
help from these groups to develop the product.  Although we can use various teleconferencing technologies 
to share development knowledge, funding constraints will limit how often we can meet face-to-face.
</p>

<p>
If we make the conservative assumption that future development will be supported through a succession 
of lone developers, then it is best to assume that project memory about design will more likely be 
conveyed through written rather than through oral means.

<h3>
<a name="develop_tool_suite">
Develop a tool suite rather than a tool to cater to different types of users
</a>
</h3> 
RIF v3.0 was developed as a single desktop application that was mainly used by epidemiologists.  
However, today the application must support features for statisticians and advanced features for RIF 
managers.  In developing a single monolithic application that supports all users, there is a risk that 
the maintenance costs of maintaining features for one group will be influenced by the maintenance of 
unrelated features.

<p>
Separating requirements based on the type of user and the type of task helps streamline development 
of electronic forms and can promote the development of isolated code modules that can be maintained 
independently of one another.  For example, the features an epidemiologist needs to create and run a 
study are very different than the features a RIF manager might need to load new geospatial data into 
the database.  By catering separate tools to separate kinds of users, developers can work on making the 
language of interaction more meaningful: the epidemiologist does not have to see menus relating to JSON 
file formats and the RIF manager does not have to look over fields that describe ICD codes for a given study.
</p>

<p>
Even within each role, the nature of the tasks can be very different.  Whereas creating a study 
requires many data entry features, retrieving study results requires different features for visualising 
the results.  As well, a single scientist will create a study but the results may become available to 
many of them.  Similarly, the tasks RIF managers perform as part of loading population data into the 
database are very different than the task of inspecting study results for information governance 
concerns.
</p>

<p>
Recasting the RIF as a collection of tools allows concerns about accessibility and security to be 
better managed.  For example, it may be desirable to allow a scientist or even the public to remotely 
view study results using a web browser.  However, there may not be a similar need to allow a RIF manager 
web-based access to features that would add or delete data from the RIF database.  If all of the features 
were to be supported in a single web application, the system might unnecessarily expose vulnerabilities 
to malicious code attacks. 
</p>

<p>
Now consider if these types of features were supported in different applications.  Suppose the features 
for viewing study results were supported in a publically accessible web application.  Further suppose that 
the data loading facilities were supported by a desktop application installed within a secure corporate 
Intranet, on the server that hosts the database.  The application for viewing study results would still 
expose the web server to outside malicious attacks.  However, the attack surface (the set of exposed 
vulnerabilities) would be reduced because the access to data loading features would be more restricted.  
</p>

<p>
Resolving support of the entire feature set into support for a collection of specialised tools provides 
another means of distributing work within the development team.  For example, one person could work on 
the study retrieval tool while another works on the mechanics of the data loader tool.  If the team 
grows, it becomes easier to assign discrete programming tasks that will not cause clashes in concurrent 
development.
</p>

<h2>
<a name="use_web_and_desktop">
Use a mix of web-based applications and desktop applications to suit different users
</a>
</h2>
<p>
In designing the electronic forms for the tools, there are at least three needs which have 
influenced the technologies we chose to use:
<ul>
<li>
the need to minimise the cost of installing the RIF for different users
</li>
<li>
the need to promote visibility of study results for a potentially broad audience
</li>
<li>
the need to minimise the skill set needed to maintain code
</li>
<li>
the need to minimise security vulnerabilities
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
RIF v3.0 needed to be installed on the desktop of each user.  Apart from the effort needed to 
ensure each installation had been properly configured, the tool's dependence on licenses of 
underlying commercial applications added further cost to servicing more users.  For some public 
health groups, the task of installing the RIF would require effort by whatever ICT department 
managed the networks and user permissions of the systems they used.
</p>

<p>
Deploying a software tool as a web application can help minimise the effort needed to configure 
the systems used by end-users.  Efforts for setting up the software can be focused on a single 
centralised installation.  Web applications would also allow epidemiologists to remotely submit 
their studies or view their results.  
</p>

<p>
However, web applications also come with drawbacks. It can cost less to initially create a Java 
Swing application than it does to create a web application to do the same thing.  Electronic forms 
created using Java Swing are using technology that already comes with standard Java libraries that 
are already being used to support development in other parts of the code.  Web-based forms usually 
require multiple technologies to work together in order to achieve the same effect.  In the case of 
the RIF, our web applications render electronic forms using HTML5 and PHP code, and rely on Ajax 
and Jersey web services to obtain data needed to populate analagous forms. 
</p>

<p>
As well, web-based forms can incur higher long term maintenance costs.  Technologies that are used 
to support web-based electronic forms evolve at a faster rate than the relatively stable Java Swing 
libraries used to create desktop forms.  Creating and maintaining web-based forms requires a higher 
programming skill set because they rely on more technologies.


<p>
The other major drawback of web applications is that they often expose more security vulnerabilities 
than desktop applications.  In a desktop application, data are entered manually through explicit 
user actions.  In a web application, those same actions can either be caused by a user or they can 
be caused by another program.  A web application functions by submitting requests from a web application 
that runs on a web server.  
</p>

<p>
The web server receives requests as URLs, which are then forwarded to the application to translate 
into meaningful commands.  However, those same URLs can be submitted by a malicious programming script.  
Web bots can repeatedly try to access the web application, search for vulnerabilities or disguise 
malicious code as form field values.
</p>

<p>
The benefits of developing web applications must be balanced with the development costs and security 
concerns that come with maintaining them.  The best balance is to develop web applications for the 
epidemiologists and to create desktop applications to help RIF managers perform data loading and 
information governance activities.
