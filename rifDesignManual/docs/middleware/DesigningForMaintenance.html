<h1>Designing for Maintenance</h1>

<p>
<i>
by <a href="mailto:kgarwood@users.sourceforge.net">Kevin Garwood</a>
</i>
</p>

<p>
One of the major reasons the RIF was redeveloped was because it could no longer be
maintained. It developed a critical dependence on a piece of software that could not
be substituted and had an impact on the development of the entire code base.  One of 
our major design goals in developing the latest RIF is to make it easier to isolate
the scope of dependencies on different technologies so that the code base is robust
enough to survive aspects of obsolescence.
</p>

<p>
Dividing up the code base based on technological dependencies also allows developers 
skilled in different technologies to work efficiently with one another.  For example,
the code used to maintain the JavaScript code for client applications is maintained
independently of either the Java code used to support the middleware or the PostgreSQL
scripts used to set up and configure the RIF database.  Isolating code by technology
allows the project to leverage the value of different languages and libraries where it
will have the most effect.
</p>

<p>
We must also consider the changing composition of our team and the environment within which
we would expect future development to occur.  In the past, versions of the RIF were
maintained by one or two developers.  In the present, multiple developers will work on it
in a part time capacity, making contributions that best suit their strengths.  In a team
of multiple developers, lowering software maintenance costs may mean making it easier to 
maintain coding that is either divided amongst more developers or consolidated by fewer.
</p>

<p>
Another consideration for lowering maintenance costs is to lower the skill required by
new developers being brought onto the project.  Academic projects often have to compete
with industry for skilled talent.  If the project invests in niche technologies and 
advanced design features, there is a risk the project will not be able to maintain the
code base for the long term because of natural staff turnover.  Therefore, it is best
wherever possible to make the code base simple enough so that developers with minimal 
skill can make changes.
</p>

<p>
Our last major consideration for designing for maintenance is minimising repetitive code.
Having fragments of repetitive code in the code base makes the software brittle and more
likely to incur errors should a fragment need to change.

<h2>
Organising the code to promote a division of labours
</h2>

<h3>Dividing labour by computing concern</h3>
In this section, we will attempt to divide the code base into a grid of work units
that can be easily divided amongst multiple developers.  The first division is made
possible by two general design decisions we made:

<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#gen_design2">
General Design-2
</a>
</b>: 
Organise code using a common three tier architecture that has the following layers: a presentation layer 
for managing GUI code; a business concept layer for managing the way business concepts are expressed 
in the system; and a data storage layer for managing the task of reading data from or writing data 
to the database.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
and
</p>

<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#gen_design3">
General Design-3
</a>
</b>: 
Ensure that the presentation layer only interacts with the data storage layer via the business concept 
layer.  Never let presentation and data storage layer have direct communication with one another.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
These two decisions mean that changes made to electronic forms in the presentation layer
should not cause changes in the data storage layer.  The classes in the business concept
layer are designed, wherever possible, to be neutral with respect to how their data are 
stored or displayed.  Therefore, changes in either the presentation layer or the data storage
layer should have minimal impact on classes in the business concept layer.
</p>

<p>
Changes in the business classes will likely cause changes in both the data storage 
layer and the presentation layer.  However, these changes will appear very predictable
for developers.  For example, if a new field is added to a business class, it will likely
cause a new form field to be added in the presentation layer and another field value to
set in the data storage layer.  A significant number of changes may be needed in the code
base, but because most layers will mirror concepts and properties of the business class
layer, the changes will likely be predictable.
</p>


<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#maintenance1">
Maintenance-1
</a>
</b>: 
Leverage the division of responsibilities in the three tiered architecture so that 
a code change in one layer can have a predictable cascade of changes in other layers. 
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
Where code in one layer cannot be insulated by changes in another, the cascade of changes
that are needed should be predictable.  The following diagram shows how adding a new
field to the Investigation business class could cause changes that ripple throughout
the code base.  
</p>

<img src="../img/PropagationOfChanges.jpg">


Adding a field to <code>Investigation</code> would cause changes in
web services that supported browser-based client applications in the presentation layer.
The JavaScript files used to support the browser application would need to be changed
to show the new field values that would be provided by the web services. The original desktop 
prototype of the Study Submission Tool does not use web services, so it would respond directly 
to changes in the business class layer.
<p>

<p>
The new field would also cause changes to happen in layers that managed <code>
Investigation</code> data in the database and that serialised the data for file
formats such as HTML and XML.
</p>






<p>
The powerful influence of changes in the business concept layer on other layers means 
that new developers will learn the codebase most quickly if they consult the business
concept layer first.  Once they learn about the business classes and the service APIs,
most of other code should appear easier to understand.
</p>


<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#maintenance2">
Maintenance-2
</a>
</b>:
Because the business concept layer plays such an important role in the propagation of
changes, this is the layer that developers who are new to the code base should learn 
first. 
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>


<h3>
Dividing labour by tool
</h3>

<p>
Next, the code base will be divided up by tool rather than by type of computing concern.
The main feature areas of the software are reflected in its four tools, which are
listed from most to least development priority:

<ol>
<li>
Study Submission Tool
</li>

<li>
Study Result Retrieval Tool
</li>

<li>
Data Loader Tool
</li>

<li>
Information Governance Tool
</li>

</ol>

<p>
Although the Study Submission and Study Result Retrieval tools share many features,
the rest of the tools do not.  Where tools may share an interest in using the same
database table fields, they are not likely to interfere with one another.  For example,
when the Data Loader Tool is loading new data, none of the other tools should be active.
</p>

<p>
That the tools may use different resources at different times does not mean changes made
in one tool will not affect the others.  However, they tend to be isolated from one 
another to help assist a clear division of roles amongst developers.
</p>



<h3>
Dividing labour by service API method
</h3>

<p>
In our discussion of concurrency, we described one measure where we try to reduce the 
state of classes used to support service methods:
</p>

<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#concurrency10">
Concurrency-10
</a>
</b>: 
Where it is possible, favour using method variables over using class variables.  Class variables can be
accessed by multiple threads, but local variables in methods will be used by only a single calling thread.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Minimising state can help lower maintenance costs as well.  If two service methods
depend on the same resource, then changes to the way one method uses it may 
cause concerns about side effects in the other.  The less state these methods share
with one another, the less the coding of one service method may be influenced 
by the coding of another.  
</p>

<p>
Although we know that methods do in fact share common resources, the tendency for 
them to be reasonably independent from one another makes a division of labour by 
service call reasonable to do.  In general, two developers can each be assigned 
to maintain a specific service method without having too much concern
about how their work would effect one another.
</p>

<p>
The following diagram combines the various strategies we have discussed to divide
up the code to divide labours.
</p>

<p>
<img src="../img/DivisionOfLabour.jpg">
</p>

<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#maintenance3">

</a>
</b>:
Create a grid showing areas of software maintenance that can be assigned to 
developers.  Create the grid by combining divisions in the code base that are based on:
<ul>
<li>
computing concern (ie: presentation layer, business concept layer, data storage layer)
</li>
<li>
by tool (ie: Study Submission Tool, Study Result Retrieval Tool, Data Loader Tool, 
Information Governance Tool) 
</li>
<li>
individual methods of service APIs
</li>
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>


<h2>
Minimising repetitive code
</h2>
So far, we have organised the code in a way that could allow multiple developers
to work on discrete coding tasks whose scope of effect would be well known.  In
this part of the discussion, we try to minimise the amount of repetitive code. 



<h3>
Using inheritance to manage repetitive code in similar classes
</h3>
The first step in minimising repetition of code is to identify classes which
have enough common behaviour to warrant moving parts of their code into a common
super class. There are examples of overlapping behaviour amongst classes in
the code base.  These include:
<ul>
<li>
the great overlap between test and production versions of service classes
</li>
<li>
overlapping properties in business classes, such as all of those which have a 
name attribute
</li>
<li>
overlapping properties of manager classes which may all need to know about
properties of the underlying database
</li>
</ul>


<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#maintenance4">
Maintenance-4
</a>
</b>:
Consolidate repetitive code in similar classes using inheritance.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>



<p>
One weakness of developing an inheritance hierarchy of classes is that some subclasses
may not need properties or methods from their superclasses.  For example, one of the 
basic properties of almost all RIF business classes is an identifier field, which is
meant to hold a primary key that corresponds to a record in the database.  For example,
in the class <code>DiseaseMappingStudy</code> the identifier contains a number which
can be linked to an auto-generated primary key in a table describing studies.  However,
in the class <code>Geography</code>, identifier is not used at all.  This is because
in the database, a geography is identified by its name, which acts as a natural key.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, an identifier field will likely be used by classes which correspond to 
auto-generated primary keys, but not those which correspond with natural keys.
Despite the awkward fit of the identifier field with some of its subclasses, 
using inheritance to consolidate repetitive code provides a lot of benefit.
</p>

<p>
In some parts of the code, we have used inheritance to anticipate future subclasses
that which embody business concepts that are not fully understood.  For example, we
currently only support disease mapping studies.  However, we will soon be investigating
the properties of risk analysis studies.  We have made 
<code>rifServices.businessConceptLayer.DiseaseMappingStudy</code>
inherit from <code>rifServices.businessConceptLayer.AbstractStudy</code> because we 
anticipate they will share most of the same properties.  However, we have developed
the superclass to make it easier for us to move code convergent behaviour into the
<code>AbstractStudy</code> class or divergent behaviour into the <code>DiseaseMappingStudy</code>
and <code>RiskAnalysisStudy</code> classes.
</p>


<p>
Although inheritance can save work, it can also add unnecessary complexity when the
subclass is unlikely to use most of the properties of its superclass.  When class B
inherits from class A and they have little in common, there can be at least two
problems:
<ul>
<li>
the class B exposes far more behaviour than it needs to other classes that might use it.
</li>
<li>
auto-generated Java Docs become more cluttered with functionality that is never
used by the class
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Unnecessary inheritance often happens when developers want to subclass Java Swing classes.  
Early in development, it was clear that most of the methods in 
<code>rifSubmissionTool.desktop.interactive.InvestigationEditorDialog</code>
emphasised application-specific operations rather than some generic UI issue.  
Although the <code>InvestigationEditorDialog</code> class was managing UI components, 
it had very little in common with a class such as <code>javax.swing.JDialog</code>. 
Therefore, we made <code>InvestigationEditorDialog</code> contain an instance of
<code>JDialog</code>.  In general it is better to contain rather than inherit from 
Swing classes.
</p>


<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#maintenance5">
Maintenance-5
</a>
</b>:
Avoid unnecessary inheritance when the super class and sub class would have little to
do with one another.  For example, in many cases, a class should contain rather inherit
from a Java Swing class.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>







<h3>
Using aggregation to manage repetitive code in dissimilar classes
</h3>
<p>
Inheritance works best if class A is a kind of class B.  However, in other scenarios,
the classes may not be similar enough for a superclass-subclass relationship to support
sharing code.  For example, many classes may want to use a logging class to audit
actions, even though the logger class may have nothing in common with them.
</p>

<p>
In this case, we consolidate repetitive code into utility classes that can be used in
multiple parts of the code base.  Now that we have identified patterns that would support
sharing code through inheritance, we're now interested in sharing code through
aggregation.  Specifically, we are looking for patterns that would lead us to say:
<ul>
<li>
"An object of class A uses an instance of class B" or 
</li>
<li>
"An object of class A uses an instance of class B" or 
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The following table shows examples of where we found repetitive code being
used by dissimilar classes.  In each case, we consolidated repetitive code
through the creation of new classes.
</p>

Making it easy to add future features

<h3>

<h2>
Lowering the skill required to maintain the code base
</h2>
<p>
Now that we have minimised repetitive code and organised it so that it can be maintained by multiple
developers, we need to minimise the skill needed to maintain the code base.
</p>

<h3>
Investing in design documentation
</h3>
<p>
Relying on just a code base to guide future developers is problematic because it represents
the outcome of design rather than the process of decision making which led to it.  Lowering
maintenance costs involves encouraging future developers to reuse existing code as much as
possible.  
</p>

<p>
A well described design can help developers decide whether they should retain, 
alter or retire code structures that would otherwise just carry legacy maintenance costs.
Without sufficient information about a code base's design, developers tend to adopt a policy 
of avoidance in changing existing code.  Instead, they invest in creating new code structures
that will make sense in the context of their current coding activities.
</p>

<p>
An architecture can provide scaffolding with which other developers can add
enhancements. It can tend to non-functional software concerns such as testability, security
and concurrency, which can require a high level of skill.  It can also isolate areas of the code
base, either to identify areas that require specialist knowledge, or plugin areas that could
be coded with more generalist knowledge. But all of these features only have value if they
are explained somehow.
</p>

<p>
In many projects, knowledge about the design will be conveyed orally as one developer passes 
along their knowledge to the next.  However, if we assume a future development environment of
scarce resources, it makes sense to invest effort in conveying this knowledge through 
formal documentation.
</p>

<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#maintenance7">
Maintenance-7
</a>
</b>:
Invest in making this design manual.  It can help future developers determine which code
structures should be adapted, left alone or discarded.  If they can reuse existing 
infrastructure, it means that the task of writing new code can remain an option rather than
a requirement.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>


<h3>
Adopting coding conventions and best practices
</h3>
<p>
Our <a href="CodingPhilosophy.html">coding philosophy</a> describes the importance of 
coding to convention over coding to circumstance.  Adopting
best practices allows developers with little experience to modify or create high 
quality code without their knowing how their actions achieve this.
</p>

<p>
Adapting coding conventions allows them to know where they should make changes in 
the code base.  When code bases become large, they can be intimidating for novice
developers who may not know how to modify it.  However, if packages, classes, methods
and variables follow conventions, it becomes easier for them to navigate through
thousands of lines of code.
</p>






<h3>
Isolating code that relies on different technologies
</h3>
<p>
Through our use of open source technologies to code the RIF, we will lower the monetary 
cost for projects to use it.  However, by using technologies that may be horizontally 
integrated through common standards rather than being vertically integrated within
tools by the same vendor, we can make the code base brittle.  If one of the open
source technologies we use becomes obsolete, we need a way to substitute it for another
technology.
</p>

<p>
Isolating code that relies on different technologies makes it easier to match skilled
developers with development tasks that require niche knowledge.  It also helps maximise
the amount of code that developers with less skill can maintain.
</p>

<p>
We have used different techniques to isolate the following parts of the code base that
reference various technologies:
<ul>
<li>
code that may have to know the difference between the way <code>PostgreSQL</code> 
and <code>SQL Server</code> work.
</li>
<li>
code that uses the Jersey project to support web services.
</li>
<li>
code that uses the Jackson project to convert the response from RIF service 
methods into the JSON format.
</li>
<li>
code that audits messages using the logging tool Log4J
</li>
<li>
code that uses the JavaScript library <code>Node.js</code>
<li>
code that uses <code>R</code> to apply Bayesian smoothing statistics methods to 
study results. 
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Our use of the three-tier architecture allows us to insulate the presentation layer
and the business concept layer from the way SQL queries are executed with <code>PostgreSQL</code>
or <code>SQL Server</code> databases.  In the past we have tried to hide as much
vendor-specific database code in stored database procedures.  However, we now expect
that the middleware may have to construct vendor-specific database code.  When this happens,
the impact of changes should not affect code in the other two main layers of the architecture.
</p.

<p>
In some cases, we have used <code>inheritance</code> to help hide a technology from its 
sub classes.  For example, the only references to the Jackson project are within
protected methods that begin with "serialise".  
</p>

<p>
In other cases, we've relied on <code>aggregation</code> to hide references to other technologies.
We have experienced problems incorporating the Log4J logging framework into the 
software.  We eventually disabled it until we have time to address the problem.  However,
we minimised the impact of the problem by hiding its use within the class
<code>rifServices.util.RIFLogger</code>.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes we have managed to reduce the impact of a technology on the code base by 
creating more code instead of less code.  Jackson makes use of Java XML bind annotations
in a class so that it can determine how to serialise the fields as a JSON String.  
</p>

<p>
We could have marked up the classes in the business concept layer using these annotations.  
However, we realised that sometimes JSON could be displayed more efficiently if the annotations 
were use in one way instead of another.  For consider a web service returning a collection
of <code>rifServices.businessConceptLayer.MapArea</code> objects.

<p>
The service could return an array of individual objects such as:
<code>
<pre>
   [{"gid":1,"id":"manc-1","label":"Manchester"},
    {"gid":2,"id":"camb-glouc","label":"Cambridge, Gloucestershire"},
    {"gid":3,"id":"camb-cam","label":"Cambridge, Cambridgeshire"}]
</pre>
</code>

<p>
Alternatively, it could return a collection of parallel arrays, which may be 
more amenable to being rendered in a table than the format above.

<code>
<pre>
   [{"gid":['1', '2', '3']},
    {"id":[ "manc-1", "camb-glouc", "camb-cam"]},
    {"label":["Manchester", "Cambridge, Gloucestershire", 
    "Cambridge, Cambridgeshire"]}]
</pre>
</code>

<p>
If we are trying to rely on Jackson to render JSON, then the way we make annotations
can affect the way it would attempt to render one of these two formats.  Rather than
trying to adapt the business classes, we decided instead to <code>develop corresponding
proxy classes</code> whose sole purpose was to support JSON serialisation for the web 
pplications.
</p>

<p>
All the code which relies on Jackson or Jersey has been isolated in the package
<code>rifServices.restfulWebServices</code>, which could help insulate the rest 
of the code base when these two projects are modified or subsituted with other 
software solutions.
