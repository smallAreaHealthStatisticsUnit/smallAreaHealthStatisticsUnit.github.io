<h1>RIF Architecture: Presentation Layer</h1>

<p>
<i>
by <a href="mailto:kgarwood@users.sourceforge.net">Kevin Garwood</a>
</i>
</p>

<p>
In the architecture, the presentation layer is broken up into a number of client applications which 
access the database via service interfaces.  Although we anticipated that the study submission tool 
would eventually be implemented as a web application, we decided that it would be useful to first build 
a simpler desktop version of the tool. There were three main reasons for developing the desktop version 
that had planned, short-term obsolescence:
<ul>
<li>
we could rapidly prototype a desktop application in a way that would help us identify which methods should 
appear in the service APIs
</li>
<li>
the APIs could be designed in a way that was independent of technologies used to support front-ends
</li>
<li>
we could show that the same code used to support business operations could be reused with multiple front-ends
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
A design that anticipates and invites substitution of front-ends should not include business-critical logic 
in them.  In particular, if we anticipate that a desktop application may be replaced by a web-based application, 
we should not assume the front end will do any validation of form data.  The safest assumption is that the 
presentation layer will limit possible combinations of inputs through guided data entry.  However, validation 
should be done by the business and data storage layers.  Furthermore, whereas a front end should eliminate 
scenarios for how input data should be used with services, the services should anticipate any scenario for how 
the input data could be used.

</font>
</blockquote>



<p>
Code used to generate GUIs can become very repetitive and can incur a significant maintenance cost.  
There are three ways that presentation code can be simplified.  First, all the pieces of text that are 
visible to the user through labels, buttons, lists and error dialogs should be retrieved from a properties 
file instead of hard coded in the GUI code.  Using a property file, the messages can be changed without 
having to recompile the code.  With only little instruction, it is possible to have a non-technical people 
proof-read the properties file without requiring effort by developers.  Furthermore, these non-technical 
people can be used to craft versions of the properties file in other languages.
</p>

<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#maintenance1">
Maintenance-1
</a>
</b>: 
Maintain the text for all GUI components and text for error messages in a properties file.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
Second, code used to instantiate and initialise Java Swing components should be consolidated within a 
factory class.  The class rifGenericUILibrary.UserInterfaceFactory serves this purpose and is meant to 
minimise the amount of repetitive code used to create simple Swing-based GUI widgets.  The factory also 
makes it possible to customise the look and feel of GUI components for individual tools running within 
the same Java Virtual Machine.  
</p>

<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#maintenance2">
Maintenance-2
</a>
</b>: 
Centralise code for creating and initialising Java Swing components in a single factory class.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>





<p>
Third, create classes for common user interface displays.  For example, rifGenericUILibrary.OKClosePanel 
is a general-purpose class that creates a common panel of buttons which appears in the lower-right corner 
of most dialogs. Creating this class reduces repetitive code while helping to standardise the way "OK" and 
"Close" buttons appear in dialogs throughout a tool.
</p>

<p>
Fourth, isolate common UI classes into a sub-project that does not depend on RIF-specific concepts.  
Initially, we created classes the created UI components that were repeated throughout the desktop version 
of study submission tool. However, as we began to develop the Data Loader Tool, it became clear that the 
same classes would be reused in other sub-projects as well.  Therefore, we decided to isolate a small 
sub-project that was as independent of the rest of the RIF code base as possible.
</p>
	
	
<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#maintenance3">
Maintenance-3
</a>
</b>: 
Create classes that render user interface features that appear across multiple tools.  
Isolate these classes into a sub-project that shows no dependencies on 	classes that relate 
specifically to the RIF.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
Fifth, wherever possible, GUI classes should avoid inheritance from other Swing classes.  The main 
reason for this decision is that in most cases there is no need to take advantage of methods in the 
Swing super classes and inheriting from these classes can complicate the generated JavaDocs.  It is better 
to create a class that contains an instance of a JDialog rather than extends one.  The intent of the 
class and its role in the code base becomes clearer.
</p>


	
<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#maintenance4">
Maintenance-4
</a>
</b>: 
Contain rather than inherit from GUI classes.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
The main exception for this convention is the practice of extending <code>javax.swing.AbstractTableModel</code>, 
which is designed to support common implementations of the <code>TableModel</code> interface.
