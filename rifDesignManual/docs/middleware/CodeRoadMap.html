<h1>Code Road Map</h1>
<p>
<i>
by <a href="mailto:kgarwood@users.sourceforge.net">Kevin Garwood</a>
</i>
</p>

This section is supposed to make it easy for new developers to learn how to familiarise
themselves with the code base.  As the figure below shows, the code is divided into a number 
of sub-projects, some of which depend on one another.  

<img src="../img/RIFSubProjects.jpg">
<p>

We recommend that you learn about the code by following these steps:
<ol>
<li>
Learning about the <code>rifServices</code> sub-project.  Specifically, focus on classes
in the <code>rifServices.businessConceptLayer</code>.  The business classes describe
the kinds of concepts that are involved in the RIF's environmental health studies.  The
service interfaces (source files ending in "API") describe the behaviour of the middleware 
and indicate what a client application can get it to do.
</li>
<li>
Most of the other packages in <code>rifServices.businessConceptLayer</code> in some way mirror
the concepts in the business concept layer.  For example, the classes in the 
<code>rifServices.fileFormats</code> project use different file formats to serialise and deserialise 
business objects.
</li>

<li>
Learn how test cases are designed.  First examine the test suites in 
<code>rifServices.test.businessConceptLayer</code>.  These test cases are easy to run because
they don't involve contacting the database.
</li>

<li>
Now look at test cases designed for testing service methods.
</li>

<li>
Once you learn how the rifServices sub package, then it will be easy to learn the packages 
<code>rifSubmissionTool</code> and <code>rifDataLoaderTool</code>.  Each major tool in the tool
suite will divide its code into presentation, business concept and data storage layers. Each
of the tools will have a front end which uses the database via service interfaces.
</li>

</ol>






<h2>
Summary of subprojects
</h2>
The table below describes various aspects of each sub project and serves two learning purposes
here:
<ul>
<li>
it describes what kind of code you should expect to find in each of the sub projects
</li>
<li>
it provides criteria that can guide you when you are wondering where you should put new
classes you create
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cross-Project Naming Convention</h2>
<p>
Understanding the code base is made easier if you keep in mind a few naming conventions 
which can appear in multiple projects.  The following table of conventions should
help you tell what a lot of the classes do without requiring you to look at the code
in them.
</p>


<h3>Naming Conventions</h3>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
<b>
Convention
</b>
</td>

<td>
<b>
Meaning
</b>
</td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Packages marked <code> *.presentationLayer </code>
</td>

<td>
Contains classes that are used to generate Swing-based front ends.  The front end code
is responsible for converting data between forms and business objects.  It interacts with
the database by using business objects with calls to service interfaces.
</td>

</tr>



<tr>
<td>
Packages marked <code> *.businessConceptLayer </code>
</td>

<td>
Contains definitions of business classes and service interfaces.  In any subproject,
you should examine this package first.
</td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Packages marked <code> *.dataStorageLayer </code>
</td>

<td>
Contains classes that use business objects to assemble SQL queries, which are then executed
in the database.  Typically the results of the SQL queries are packaged into business objects.
</td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Packages marked <code> *.system </code>
</td>

<td>
Contains classes that are used throughout a subproject.  For example, 
<code>rifServices.system.RIFServiceError</code> is an enumeration of error causes, and is
used throughout the <code>rifServices</code>subproject</code>.
</td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Packages marked <code> *.fileFormats </code>
</td>

<td>
Contains classes that are used to serialise or deserialise business objects using one or
more file formats (eg: XML, HTML, CSV).
</td>

</tr>


<tr>
<td>
Source files marked <code>Abstract*</code>
</td>

<td>
Abstract classes.
</td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Source files marked <code>*API</code>. 
</td>

<td>
interfaces that define the behaviour of services which are used by front end 
applications. They should always appear within a <code>businessConceptLayer</code> package.
</td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Source files marked <code>*Service</code>.  
</td>

<td>
Classes that implement a service interface (<code>*API</code>).  They should always appear 
within a <code>businessConceptLayer</code> package.  <code>Test*Service</code> classes
are usually used for testing and contain methods that can help reset the service or the
database to a known state.  <code>Production*Service</code> classes are what users will
use and will not have these kinds of methods.
</td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Source files marked <code>SQL*</code>.
</td>

<td>
Indicates the file is involved with generating or executing SQL queries.
</td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Source files marked <code>*Manager</code>.
</td>

<td>
Service classes (<code>*Service</code>) often delegate much of the work for
their methods to corresponding methods in <code>*Manager</code> delegation
classes.  A manager class is responsible for managing queries related to 
one or more business classes.  For example, the 
<code>rifServices.dataStorageLayer.SQLCovariateManager</code> is responsible
for managing <code>ExposureCovariate</code> and <code>AdjustableCovariate</code>
classes found in the <code>rifServices.businessConceptLayer</code> package.
</td>

</tr>

</table>



<h2>Individual Subprojects</h2>

<h3>Subproject: rifGenericLibrary</h3>
This subproject is meant to hold classes which are used across multiple projects and have
no reason to be dependent on RIF concepts.  For example, it holds a collection of 
convenience classes which can create common UI features in the Swing front ends.  The
classes are or will be reused in the electronic forms that are part of three subprojects:
<ul>
<li>
<code>rifSubmissionTool</code> 
</li>
<li>
<code>rifDataLoaderTool</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>rifITGovernanceTool</code>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The subproject also contains a collection of query formatter classes, which help centralise
repetitive tasks that are part of concatenating parts of common SQL queries.  Like the
UI classes, the query formatter classes do not rely on any business concepts that are specific
to the RIF.
</p>

<p>
During the lifetime of the software, we expect to migrate any class to this subproject which
may later be reused on unrelated software projects.  Developers who modify code in this subproject
will not require specialised domain knowledge in order to make improvements.
</p>

used to help construct different types of SQL queries.  The formatters are designed
to manage issues such as indentations, adding comments and managing case sensitivity.
They may also be modified so they can render different outputs depending on whether
the database being used is PostgreSQL or SQL Server.
</td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<code>
*ButtonPanel, *ComboBox, *ListPanel, *Panel
</code>
</td>

classes that contain various common UI components.

<h3>Subproject: rifServices</h3>
<p>
This subproject contains all the business concepts, service interfaces and service
classes that support front ends for the Study Submission Tool and the Study
Result Retrieval Tool.  Code for the two tools is grouped together because they
share many of the same business concepts and the same features.
</p>

<p>
The general naming conventions can tell you what most of these classes do.  There are
a few notable classes:
<ul>
<li>
<code>rifServices.dataStorageLayer.SQLConnectionManager</code> is used to handle connection
pooling for all of the other tools.  
</li>
<li>
<code>rifServices.util.RIFLogger</code> is used to handle all calls to log messages.  It hides
references to SL4J from the rest of the code base.
</li>
<li>
<code>rifServices.system.RIFServiceStartupProperties</code> reads a property file that helps
the middleware understand database properties such as the host, the port, whether it is SQL Server
or PostgreSQL and the names of directories containing resource files.
</li>
<li>
<code>rifServices.util.FieldValidationUtility</code> has the only code in the code base which
does the work of comparing a String against malicious patterns of code (eg: SQL injection attacks).
</li>
<li>
<code>rifServices.dataStorageLayer.HealthOutcomeManager</code> will probably be the only manager 
class in a <code>*.dataStorageLayer</code> package that does not rely on database queries.  It
manages taxonomy services that are managed by independent services.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<tr>
<td>
<code>
*Proxy
</code>
</td>

<td>
These are classes whose sole purpose is to make is easier for the Jackson library to serialise
RIF business objects.  They are data container classes marked up with Java annotatations so
that Jackson's <code>ObjectMapper</code> class can serialise business objects using JSON.
</td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<code>
*ServiceApplication
</code>
</td>

<td>
Advertise a particular web service.  The Java annotations in these classes
are used to help build the URL fragment that identifies the service.  For example
"/studySubmission" and "/studyResultRetrieval".
</td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<code>
*ServiceResource
</code>
</td>

<td>
Advertise a set of web service methods.  These classes convert URL parameters into Java 
objects, which are then passed to the Java service classes (<code>*API</code>).  The 
<code>*ServiceResource</code> classes convert results into JSON.
