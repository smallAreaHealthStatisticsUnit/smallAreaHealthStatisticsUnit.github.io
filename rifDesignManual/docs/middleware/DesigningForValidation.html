<h1>Designing for Validation</h1>

<p>
<i>
by <a href="mailto:kgarwood@users.sourceforge.net">Kevin Garwood</a>
</i>
</p>

<h2>Limiting the scope of development efforts</h2>
<p>
Our first step in designing the RIF for validation is to limit what parts of the code base that will
support validation activities.  In the three-layer architecture, validation will be divided between 
the business concept layer and the data storage layer.  Although validation code could be included 
in the presentation layer, there are two reasons for <i>not</i> placing any emphasis of validation 
in this layer:
<ul>
<li>
we anticipate that new client applications may be created, thereby requiring replicated validation code
</li>
<li>
we anticipate that existing client applications could be replaced by new ones that may not necessarily
support validation to the same extent
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Given that we anticipate future development of front end applications to be volatile, we believe it is
best to conserve as much business logic for validation within the business concept and data storage layers.

<blockquote>

<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#validation1">
Validation-1
</a>
</b>: 
Assume the client applications will do no validation.  Validation code will be distributed
between the business concept and data storage layers of the architecture.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
Now that we have limited our concerns about validation to the business concept and data storage layers,
we now look for other ways to economise our efforts.  In the general design of the architecture, we 
decided to limit paths of execution wherever possible.  Two general design decisions help make it easy 
to know where validation efforts should be focused:

<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#gen_design4">
General Design-4
</a>
</b>: 
Wherever possible, limit the paths of execution that are likely to occur.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#gen_design7">
General Design-7
</a>
</b>: 
Encapsulate business concept and data storage layers of the architecture through service APIs.  
Do not allow clients to know which class is implementing the service interfaces.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
The emphasis for validation should focus on validating data passed by the client:

<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#validation2">
Validation-2
</a>
</b>: 
Limit validation support to execution paths that support service API methods.  Specifically, focus 
validation efforts on validating values the client application passes to methods of service APIs.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>





<h2>
Designing the business classes to accommodate validation checks
</h2>
The next step for supporting validation is to make it easy for the client applications to rely on the middleware to
do validation.  In most client applications, form field values will be typically be Strings.  Therefore, 
if the middleware is meant to do as much validation as possible, it should accept field values as Strings.  It is best
that the business classes use mostly String fields so that the client can easily copy form fields to data fields.


<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#validation3">
Validation-3
</a>
</b>: 
By default, the fields in business classes should be of type String.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>

<h2>
Ensuring parameter values remain the same before, during and after validation checks
</h2>
In order to eliminate the prospect that parameter values passed by a client could change during the 
execution of a method code block, we make local copies of every mutable parameter value of every service method.  
This measure ensures that once parameter values have been validated, they remain valid until the method finishes.  
(See also Concurrency).
</p>


<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#concurrency9">
Concurrency-9
</a>
</b>: 
Perform a deep-copy of any mutable object that is passed to a service method by a client application.  This 
action will prevent the client from altering parameter values while they are being processed by the middleware.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>

<h2>
Identifying and ordering validation checks
</h2>
</h>
<p>
Once the parameter values have been safe-copied, we can be assured that values will remain the same when they are 
being validated.  The next step is to identify and prioritise what validation checks are applied to the
parameter values of service methods.  The order should ensure that a service request uses the least amount
of the system resources.  If an attempt to call a service method is going to fail, it should fail as 
quickly as possible and minimise how much work it makes the database do.  
</p>

<p>
Failing fast can be more important in some scenarios than others.  For example, as soon as a malicious code
attack is detected in any field of any parameter object, the method should fail as fast as possible. Likewise,
the code should react most quickly if an invalid user or one previously associated with attacks is associated
with a service call.  It is more important that these checks are done before checks that test whether a field
contains a valid data type or a value within some range.
</p>

<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#validation4">
Validation-4
</a>
</b>: 
Identify and prioritise the validation checks that are applied to the parameter values of service methods.
Order the validation checks so they
<ul>
<li>
cause validation to fail as quickly as possible and 
</li>
<li>
wherever possible, give highest priority to fail a security validation check over other types of checks 
</li>
<li>
minimise the load placed on the database.
</li>
</ul>
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>



<p>
We identified and ordered a number of validation checks for a typical service call and
described them in the table below. As well as the order, the table describes what class
is responsible for holding the code for a check and the classes that actually call that code.
For example, the code to determine whether the fields of a <code>User</code> are valid is
inside the <code>checkErrors()</code> method in that class.  However, <code>user.checkErrors()</code>
is actually invoked in the service methods that appear in the services classes such as
<code>rifServices.dataStorageLayer.AbstractRIFStudyRetrievalService</code> and 
<code>rifServices.dataStorageLayer.AbstractRIFStudySubmissionService</code>.  Where the code
is owned and where it is called help show how validation duties are distributed in the layers
of the code base.  

<p>
The table also shows whether a check requires the database.  Checking whether the field values of
a <code>Geography</code> has a valid value for its 'name' field does not require a call to the 
database.  However, knowing whether the geography "SAHSU" is known does require a call.  Note
that in the starred item marked '**', users are checked against a black list that is managed in
memory, not in the database.
