<h1>Designing for Security</h1>

<p>
<i>
by <a href="mailto:kgarwood@users.sourceforge.net">Kevin Garwood</a>
</i>
</p>


<p>
The aim of designing for security is to address the threat of malicious attacks that would damage
the RIF system and to prevent sensitive data to be disclosed to unauthorised users.  We have
designed the RIF to cope with the following threats:
<ul>
<li>
malicious attacks that seek to obtain access to sensitive information
</li>
<li>
unintentional disclosures of sensitive information
</li>
<li>
malicious code attacks that are are meant to alter or damage the database
</li>
<li>
malicious code attacks that are meant to overload the RIF system
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>
Establishing the expectations of support for security within an end-user environment
</h2>
<p>
In some projects, too much burden of addressing perceived threats is placed on the software rather
than the groups that would install it or the end-users who would use it.  The cost of having
the software cope with a large number of scenarios related to these threats can complicate 
the code base, increase the software maintenance costs, and take potentially scarce resources 
away from other aspects of development.
</p>

<p>
The first line of defence for the threats we have identified is to prescribe how the software
should be installed.  From a security perspective, the ideal arrangement would be to have 
the RIF tool suite installed on an isolated private network that was only accessible through a 
virtual desktop environment.  Results of studies would be be accessible through an encrypted
USB drive and only machines in a locked secure room would be have available USB ports.
</p>

<p>
The next best arrangement would be to make the tool suite accessible only within a corporate 
Intranet.  The RIF database would be installed on a server that was isolated within that network.
For example, it would only be available on a restricted port.
</p>

<p>
From a security perspective it would be best if the tools were not visible outside the corporate Intranet.
However, we recognise that some projects may want to grant wider access to tools.  Although we have 
designed the RIF so that all its tools can be supported with web-based applications, we have decided 
that initially, the Data Loader Tool and the IT Governance Tool will be deployed as desktop 
applications.  There are security benefits for using this kind of deployment.
</p>

<p>
Desktop applications typically require human users to interact with electronic forms in order to access the 
underlying data storage.  In contrast, the requests that support user interaction in web applications can be 
imitated by malicious automated scripts.  Both web-browser applications and malicious scripts submit requests
via URLs, which are processed by a web server.  When a web server receives a request, it cannot make 
assumptions about the client that is calling it.  

<p>
Desktop applications can be made to rely on web servers as well, thereby exposing them to the same
vulnerabilities as web applications.  However, because both the front end code for the administration tools 
and the middleware are both written in Java, it means that client applications can call a Java middleware 
service directly.  Whereas web services emphasise interoperability between different technologies, 
the Java service interfaces stress integration using the same technology.  In this development context, 
integration can provide fewer opportunities for threats than interoperability.
</p>

 
<p>
Clearly the Study Submission and Study Result Viewer tools need to be deployed as web applications.  In this
deployment context, the web server needs to be configured so that it can securely handle URL requests
coming from outside the corporate network.  The web server should be isolated from the rest of the network
as much as possible.
</p>

The RIF Tool Suite should be installed within a secure corporate Intranet.  The database server
for the RIF should be isolated within that network, and its database access ports should be strictly limited.

</font>
</blockquote>
		

<p>
In the short term, our decision to initially develop the administration tools as desktop applications should
help reduce the vulnerabilities from automated script attacks.  However, in the long term, these tools may 
end up being reworked as web applications.  In that case, it does not make sense to rely on the security
benefits of any one kind of front-end in the presentation layer.  Although we hope they could prevent
malicious code attacks, we shouldn't assume they will.
</p>

Design middleware methods for each tool as if it will be deployed as a web application.  However,
in the short term of RIF development, tools that do not require remote access should be developed as
desktop applications that use Java-based RIF services.  Tools that require remote access should be
developed as web applications that communicate with the middleware via web services.  The web server
should be isolated from the rest of the corporate Intranet. 
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>


<h2>
Addressing threat of malicious code attacks
</h2>

<p>
One of the most significant ways of reducing the risk of security threats is to reduce the attack surface that
is provided by the code base.  An attack surface is the total number of points where a malicious attacker can 
access the system.  We have reduced the attack surface in three ways:
<ul>
<li>
minimise the visibility of variables, methods, classes and packages as much as possible
</li>
<li>
make all non-abstract classes final
</li>
<li>
encapsulate the business concept layer and the data storage layer using service interfaces that can hide
implementation details from client applications
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#gen_design4">
General Design-4
</a>
</b>: 
Wherever possible, limit the paths of execution that are likely to occur.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
After taking these measures, the attack surface of the middleware code base should be limited to the methods
published in the service APIs.  The next step in securing the code base is to make copies of mutable values
that the client applications pass to service methods.  This is called the "safe copying" technique,
and it is discussed in the <a href="./DesignForConcurrency.html">Concurrency</a> section.
</p>



<p>
After we create local copies of the parameter objects, the middleware then refers to the parameter objects 
it created rather than the objects that were produced by the client.  The local copies are insulated from
any malicious changes that may occur in the original objects during the course of executing a service
method.  

For example, a malicious script could initially call the method 

<code>
<pre>
   getGeoLevelSelectValues(
      User user,
      Geography geography) 
      throws RIFServiceException;
</pre>
</code>	
	
found in the <code>rifServices.businessConceptLayer.RIFStudySubmissionAPI</code> interface.  Suppose it
passed a parameter value <code>Geography</code> which could pass the tests done in the object's 
<code>checkSecurityViolations()</code> method.  Sometime after these checks were done, the client could
have a thread that manages to set one of the <code>Geography</code> fields to an SQL injection attack.
A malicious client could use threads to change a valid object into a harmful one.  To prevent this, we would
make a copy of <code>Geography<code> and refer to that.  When the client tried to change values, it would
have no effect on the middleware because it wasn't using the client's copy of <code>Geography</code>.


<blockquote>

<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#concurrency9">
Concurrency-9
</a>
</b>: 
Perform a deep-copy of any mutable object that is passed to a service method by a client application.  This 
action will prevent the client from altering parameter values while they are being processed by the middleware.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
The next step is to find out if the userID associated with the method call has been blacklisted 
for past calls that contained malicious code.  This check is done first so that an unauthorised user's attempt
to access the RIF database will fail as soon as possible.
</p>


<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#security3">
Security-3
</a>
</b>: 
Consider a service method which has a <code>User</code> object specified as a parameter.  Immediately after the 
<code>User</code> object has been safe-copied, check whether the userID in the copy has been blacklisted.  If
executing the service method results in a security exception, blacklist the user.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
The next security measure is to check every String field of every parameter object for whether the values
resemble known forms of SQL Injection or SQL cross scripting attacks.  This check should be done immediately
after parameter values are safe copied and checked for empty values.
</p>


<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#security4">
Security-4
</a>
</b>: 
Business classes should have a method <code>checkSecurityViolations()</code>, which recursively 
check whether any String fields have any malicious code values.  Field values should be compared 
against a variable collection of regular expression patterns that are commonly associated with 
code attacks.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
The task of checking whether a String value matches a pattern of malicious code should be 
supported by a single piece of extensible code that can be driven from an externally supplied list
of malicious patterns.  The checks need to be done at a single point in the code base to ensure
that the matching activity can be applied uniformly to the parameters of all middleware methods.  

<p>
Furthermore, the list of malicious code patterns should not be hard coded. Instead, it should
read the patterns from a text file that can be altered as new forms of code attacks emerge.  The 
RIF software should come with a default list of patterns, but it should allow projects to 
modify it.  Some projects may not feel comfortable relying on a set of patterns which is visible
in a publicly available open source project.
</p>

<p>

<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#security5">
Security-5
</a>
</b>: 
The class <code>rifServices.util.FieldValidationUtility</code> will be responsible for checking
all String field values contain malicious code patterns.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>



<p>
The collections of code patterns used to detect malicious values in String input data should not
be hard coded in the application.  Instead they should be read from a file once at startup.
The file will contain a default list of patterns that can be altered by individual projects.
</p>


<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#security6">
Security-6
</a>
</b>: 
The class <code>rifServices.util.FieldValidationUtility</code> will obtain its list of 
malicious code patterns from an editable file <code>MaliciousCodePatterns.txt</code>.
Projects may wish to modify this file so they can add additional patterns in response
to new threats of code attacks.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
After parameter objects have been safely copied and every String input value has been
checked for malicious code patterns, we switch focus from detection to prevention of
attacks.
</p>

<p>
The RIF uses <code>rifServices.dataStorageLayer.SQLConnectionManager</code> to manage a
pool of database connections. In some software projects, a single pool is created where
anonymous <code>Connection</code> objects can be assigned to the next user request that 
needs one. 

<p>
In the RIF project, <code>Connection</code> objects are pooled per user to 
provide more safeguards that would prevent a user from attempting to inappropriately 
access the database.  When the middleware creates a new <code>Connection</code> object,
it immediately calls a database procedure <code>rif40_setup</code>.  This procedure 
creates user-specific views and temporary tables.  Should a malicious attack be executed 
using a given connection, the limitations of access for the associated user should help 
limit the damage.
</p>

<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#security7">
Security-7
</a>
</b>: 
Support connection pooling on a per-user basis rather than having a pool of anonymous
connections that can be shared by different users.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#security8">
Security-8
</a>
</b>: 
Call a database procedure that helps create user-specific views and temporary views.
This action makes it easier to control what users can access and what damage they
could do if their identities were used as part of a malicious attack.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
Another way of using database connections to prevent malicious attacks is to use read-only 
connections wherever possible.  Each connection object can be configured so that they only 
support read operations.  Most of the service methods used for widely accessible services
such as <code>rifServices.businessConceptLayer.RIFStudySubmissionAPI</code> and 
<code>rifServices.businessConceptLayer.RIFStudyResultRetrievalAPI</code>.
</p>

<p>
Suppose that a malicious client is calling a read only method such as:

<pre>
<code>
ArrayList<GeoLevelSelect> getGeoLevelSelectValues(
   User user,
   Geography geography)
   throws RIFServiceException;
</code>
</pre>


<p>
Further suppose that a malicious client has caused the middleware to create a query to delete
database tables.  If the query is executed on a read-only <code>Connection</code> used, 
an exception will be thrown, indicating that an attempt to do a write operation was being made.
</p>


<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#security9">
Security-9
</a>
</b>: 
For each user, maintain separate pools for read-only and write-enabled connections.  If a
middleware task does not require writing data, it should use a read-only connection.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
The main way we prevent malicious code attacks is to construct SQL queries using Java's
<code>java.sql.PreparedStatement</code>.  A <code>PreparedStatement</code> uses bind
variables that help guarantee that query parameter values could never be confused with
database commands.  The use of prepared statements helps guarantee that a malicious
command will simply be interpreted as a parameter value.
</p>

<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#security10">

</a>
</b>: 
Execute queries using Java's <code>PreparedStatement</code> class and use bind variables to
set query parameters.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>

<h2>
Preventing sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorised users
</h2>

<p>
This area of design relates to managing registered users and associating them with roles
and privileges.  Aspects of authorisation and authentication are complex, are often dependent
on network and operating system considerations, and may be difficult to install.  For now,
the RIF database will manage data about its registered users rather than relying on some
external technologies.
</p>


<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#security11">
Security-11
</a>
</b>: 
The RIF tool suite will manage user identities in the RIF database rather than delegate to services
that might already be part of network administration services.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
The RIF supports user roles that include: RIF manager, RIF student, RIF user, and RIF no suppression.
The database uses these roles to limit access permissions of registered users.  For example,
only users who have the role of RIF manager will be able to use the Data Loader Tool and the Information
Governance Tool.  A RIF user will be able to see their own studies but not anyone else's studies.
</p>


<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#security12">
Security-12
</a>
</b>: 
The middleware will rely on the database's system roles to help limit the access users have to data.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>


<h2>
Minimising sensitive information in error messages
</h2>
<p>
Another source of security problems is revealing sensitive information through error 
messages.  For example, suppose someone wanted to identify a userID in the system.  If they 
tried <code>kgarwood</code> with a random password, they could get a message such as <code>"Incorrect 
password for kgarwood"</code>, which would tell someone that <code>kgarwood</code> was probably a 
legitimate userID.  Instead, it is better to show the response: <code>"You entered an incorrect user 
name or password"</code>, which would tell a hacker less useful information.
</p>

<p>

<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#security13">
Security-13
</a>
</b>: 
Error messages resulting from invalid login should not reveal information about whether a userID
is valid.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>

<p>
It is not good practice to pass a <code>SQLException</code> back to the client applications.
Apart from it not providing much human-readable information to end-users, the exception could 
also include sensitive information that could help hackers learn more about data sets.  We are 
not concerned with whether the names of tables or table fields defined in the RIF schema are 
displayed to an end-user.  These are a matter of public knowledge through our open sourcing efforts.  
However, there is still a risk that exceptions could contain sensitive data. Therefore, we adopt
the policy that if an SQLException is created, it must be caught and logged before throwing
a <code>RIFServiceException</code> that contains an intelligible error message.  We will ensure
that error messages do not contain any more information than they need.


<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#security14">
Security-14
</a>
</b>: 
Whenever a <code>java.sql.SQLException</code> is thrown in the code, it will be caught and logged.  A
<code>rifServices.system.RIFServiceException</code> will be thrown, and its error messages will 
not expose sensitive information beyond what is necessary.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>
