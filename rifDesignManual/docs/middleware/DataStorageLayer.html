<h1>RIF Architecture: Data Storage Layer</h1>
<p>
<i>
by <a href="mailto:kgarwood@users.sourceforge.net">Kevin Garwood</a>
</i>
</p>

The most important source files in the data storage layer are the classes which implement the service 
APIs.  For example, rifServices.businessconceptLayer.ProductionRIFStudySubmissionService</code> 
implements the service API 

<code>rifServices.dataStorageLayer.RIFStudySubmissionAPI.</code>

<p>
For reasons that are explained in the section on Designing for Testability, most of the 
implementation for <code>rifServices.dataStorageLayer.ProductionRIFStudySubmissionService</code> 
is implemented by the class <code>rifServices.dataStorageLayer.AbstractRIFStudySubmissionService</code>.
</p>

<p>
One of the design challenges for making maintainable code in this layer is that as the service 
APIs grow to include more methods, so do the classes which implement those methods.  There is a risk 
of producing a "God class" which attempts to do everything.  There are at least three ways of simplifying 
these classes:
<ul>
<li>
make them implement service APIs which have fewer methods
</li>
<li>
find ways that classes that implement service APIs can share code through a common superclass
</li>
<li>
allow these classes to delegate the main part of implementing the methods to other classes
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Rather than try to have a single service API to service all the tools, we developed separate 
service APIs for each tool in the suite.  For example, we developed separate interfaces 
<code>rifServices.businessConceptLayer.RIFStudySubmissionAPI</code> 
and rifDataLoaderTool.businessConceptLayer.RIFDataLoaderServiceAPI to separate concerns for 
submitting studies and loading health data sets.

Instead of having one service API with many methods, develop a service API for each tool instead.

</font>
</blockquote>
		
<p>
The second way we simplified the service implementation classes was to look for service APIs that 
appeared to have a lot of overlap.  The best examples are APIs for study submission and viewing study 
results.  Both APIs have a need for methods that can let client applications manipulate maps at 
different resolutions.  We have tried to maintain a correspondence between the inheritance hierarchy 
of interfaces and the inheritance hierarchy for the classes that implement them.
</p>

of implementation code.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>




<p>
The most important way of minimising the complexity of service implementation classes is to have 
them delegate to other classes for the bulk of the implementation code.  Typically, a service 
class will delegate to a method with the same name in a Manager class.  


	
<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#maintenance8">
Maintenance-8
</a>
</b>: 
Make service classes invoke delegation classes to support most of the implementation for a 
business task.  Ensure that the service class and the manager classes have a clearly defined 
separation of concerns.
</i>
</font>
</blockquote>


<p>
For delegation to work, the service and the manager classes need a clear definition of roles and a 
clear separation of concerns.
</p>


<p>
A service class will have the following responsibilities:
<ul>
<li>
make local copies of all mutable parameter values passed to service methods.  Called "safe copying", 
this technique helps ensure that the middleware is not vulnerable to changes a client may make 
to parameter values it passes while the middleware is running.
</li>
<li>
check that required parameter values are not null or empty
</li>
<li>
check for malicious code and invalid users
</li>
<li>
acquire and release database connections from a connection pool
</li>
<li>
audit attempts to perform an operation and audit any exceptions that may occur
</li>
</ul>
</p>


	
<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#data_storage_layer1">
Data Storage Layer-1
</a>
</b>: 
Classes that implement service APIs are responsible for: safe-copying parameter values; 
checking for empty or malicious values in parameters; checking for invalid users; and 
acquiring and relinquishing database connections from a pool of connections.

</i>
</font>
</blockquote>






<p>
A typical delegation Manager class will have the following responsibilities
<ul>
<li>
check for field-level data type errors and illegal combinations of field values in parameter values
</li>
<li>
assemble and execute an SQL query using Java's PreparedStatement mechanism
</li>
<li>
audit SQL exceptions
</li>
<li>
package the results as collections of business objects
</li>
<li>
ensure that result sets and statement resources are closed so that database resources are freed-up for the 
next call.
</li>
</ul>
</p>


	
<blockquote>
<font color="green">
<i>
<b>
<a href="SummaryOfDesignDecisions.html#data_storage_layer2">
Data Storage Layer-2
</a>
</b>: 
A Manager class is responsible for: calling the checkErrors() method of parameter values that 
are business objects; constructing and executing SQL queries using 	parameter values; packaging 
results as business objects; recording SQL exceptions and returning human-readable exception 
messages; closing database resources associated with obtaining results.

</i>
</font>
</blockquote>




<p>
The roles of each class will be described in greater detail in the various aspects of design that 
follow.  The important point here is that in order to allow the RIF code base cope with more 
service methods, we must rely on a class delegation chain that spreads the implementation code over 
a number of classes that can be separately maintained.

<p>
The requirement for the RIF to support both PostgreSQL and SQL Server is perhaps the greatest 
source of complexity in the middleware design.  We anticipate that as code we've written 
for PostgreSQL is ported to SQL Server, there will be a need to rewrite database queries.
</p>


<p>
Originally, the SQL queries that appeared in the <code>SQL*Manager</code> classes used a 
<code>StringBuilder</code> class to concatenate SQL phrases with tables and field names that 
suited a particular operation.  However, this task seemed repetitive, error-prone, produced 
queries that were difficult to read and which might have to be reworked so they could be executed 
with both <code>PostgreSQL</code> and <code>SQL Server</code> databases.
</p>

<p>
We later developed a set of query formatter classes, which are meant to simplify and standardise 
the way the text for SQL queries is constructed.  The classes encapsulate details for whether 
SQL key words should be in upper or lower case, and how much each line should be indented.  
They also have methods that allow clauses such as SELECT, FROM, WHERE being built up in a systematic way.  
During porting activities, it may become useful to display the SQL query that is being executed in 
order to study how it should be modified to support execution on SQL Server.  Because the construction 
of different types of queries has been standardised, it may be easy to make queries more portable 
by changing the query formatter classes.
</p>

Allow the query formatters to support changes of case and have them adopt a consistent way of 
indenting lines of SQL code to make them more readable.
