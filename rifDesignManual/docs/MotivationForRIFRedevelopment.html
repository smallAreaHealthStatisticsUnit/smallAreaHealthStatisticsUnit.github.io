<h1>RIF 3.0 and the Motivation for Redevelopment</h1>

RIF 3.0 was developed as a kind of plugin that was run within the ArcGIS platform.  ArcGIS is a 
common GIS tool that is developed by ESRI and is used to visualise geospatial data.  The plugin, 
written in Microsoft Visual Basic and managing data using Microsoft Access, was able to take 
advantage of various features and libraries that were already provided by the ArcGIS platform.  
RIF 3.0 was developed mainly by a single developer whose main work task was to produce the 
application.  The plugin was distributed to Imperial College's various public health partners, 
but it was treated as a closed source code base.  It was tested and improved on an ad hoc basis, 
mainly in response to feedback from end users.

<p>
Although the way environmental health studies were being run had not changed much over the years, 
there were multiple factors in the tool's development history which lead to its redevelopment:
<ul>
<li>
scientists developed a greater need for recording provenance when they ran studies
</li>
<li>
the size of data sets for routinely collected health data increased
</li>
<li>
the overhead for installing the RIF on a desktop was significant
</li>
<li>
changing information governance rules made it desirable to reflect management of data permissions 
within the tool chain the produced results
</li>
<li>
the cost of maintaining the tool chain for the RIF was becoming expensive
</li>
<li>
libraries used by the tool became obsolete
</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a name="old_need_track_provenance">
Need for tracking provenance became more important
</a>
</h2>
It was becoming clear that scientists had a growing need to know which version of their study 
questions were used to produce which result sets.  As projects grew in scope, more data sets 
were generated.  Reconstructing the provenance of a data set often depended on an individual 
scientist's memory, coding conventions, information governance logs and whatever notes the 
scientists chose to keep.  Relearning about old data sets was complicated by the fact that 
different people from different disciplines worked on various parts of the analysis chain.  
As the time lines for long term studies extended, projects became vulnerable to the loss of 
institutional memory of projects that came with natural turnover of staff.

<h2>
<a name="old_handle_larger_datasets">
Growth of data sets outpaced ability for older database systems to support them
</a>
</h2>
The size of the data sets was growing.  As more routinely collected data were accumulated at 
SAHSU and as the amount of data increased each year, studies became more ambitious about the 
volume of data they wanted to process.  Microsoft Access is a useful tool to use with small 
to medium-sized databases.  However, it simply couldn't scale to the size of data sets that 
were being used for analysis.  Although SAHSU was able to adapt the RIF to use Oracle, its 
other public health partners often didn't have the resources to invest in more scalable 
database technologies.

<h2>
<a name="old_installation_costs">
Desktop installations complicated setup work and licensing costs
</h2>
The installation of the RIF presented a significant overhead for whatever IT departments could 
setup and maintain the application.  RIF v3.0 was a desktop application which had to be installed 
on every machine on which it was used.   Apart from incurring an overhead for reinstalling upgrades 
on every machine, the software dependencies of each individual installation complicated licenses 
required for ArcGIS.

<h2>
<a name="old_information_governance">
Information governance rules needed support in systems which produced study results
</a>
</h2>
It was becoming more difficult to separate the UK's growing set of information governance rules 
for health data from the information systems that processed them.   There is a growing concern in 
management of population health data to audit who uses the data, how they use the data, and whether 
study results would be able to uniquely identify individuals within a population.  Traditionally the 
determination of permissions and scrutinising the results for low population cell counts has been done 
manually.  However, as more studies of growing complexity are conducted, it becomes more important to 
support these needs through software features.

<h2>
<a name="old_tool_chain_costs">
Tool chain used to support the RIF became expensive
</a>
</h2>
Fifth, the costs associated with maintaining the RIF technologies were becoming too high.  Our 
early estimates indicated that a small academic group using the RIF would have to pay £3600 per 
year for the ArcGIS license, and either £3000 per year for an SQL Server license or £20,000 per year 
for an Oracle license.  

<h2>
<a name="old_obsolete_libraries">
Critical libraries for RIF 3.0 became obsolete
</a>
</h2>
The software libraries on which RIF v3.0 relied became obsolete.  Eventually, ESRI announced that it 
would no longer support ArcGIS extensions that were written in Microsoft Visual Basic.  Because the 
entire code base for RIF v3.0 was written in the language, Imperial College had to make a difficult 
decision.  It could either continue to maintain the RIF using deprecated software libraries, or it 
could completely redevelop the code base using another set of technologies.  It was the prospect of 
having obsolete tools which ultimately made the SAHSU group to completely redevelop the RIF using a 
collection of freely available open source software tools.
