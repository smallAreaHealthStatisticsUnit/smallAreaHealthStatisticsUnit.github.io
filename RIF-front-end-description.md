RIF front-end description
=========================

David Morley, September 2017

* In this document RIF will be used to refer to the front-end of the RIF
* When I started doing the RIF, I knew no JavaScript and self-taught myself as I went along. Therefore, some of the code may be a bit odd.
* Uses the Angular 1.x JavaScript framework. There is no JQuery at all.
* Developed using NetBeans and tested mostly in Chrome
* See the GitHub wiki of how to open in NetBeans
* See the wiki to set up Tomcat, rifServices.war etc.
* All libraries need to be hard-wired as the RIF has to be standalone and not via CDNs (no internet connection if running on a private network). 
* There will be no map tiles on the private network (unless we cache them)
* Various libraries are used, see index.html. Mainly, the Bootstrap library is used for modal dialogues, Leaflet for map containers, D3 for graphs, ui-grid and ui-layout.
* There are no unit tests. Did not have the time or resources.
* See elsewhere for what the RIF does and why, just the tech explained here.

# File naming

All RIF specific files use the same convention: rif(type)-(usedby)-(description).(extension)

For example: 

	**rifc-dmap.main.js**
	*rif(controller)-(used by disease mapping dashboard)-(the main controller).(js file)*

File types can be:

| Suffix | Description	              | Extension |
|--------|----------------------------|-----------|
| c	 	 | Angular controller         | .js       |
| d		 | Angular directive	      | .js       |
| m		 | Angular module     	      | .js       |
| s		 | Angular service or factory | .js       |
| p		 | HTML partial               | .html     |
| x		 | CSS                        | .css      |

# Directory Structure

From the file root, the RIF has the following directory structure:

| Directory name | Description                                                               |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| backend        | Functionality to deal with the database via the middleware                |
| css            | RIF specific css                                                          |
| dashboards     | Functionality to deal with the main RIF tab states. e.g. viewer, login    |
| images         | Images used by the RIF                                                    |
| libs           | All third-party libraries - Hardwired in, do not use remote sources       |
| modules        | Contains the definition of the RIF angular module                         |
| utils          | Functionality shared over more than one part of the RIF                   |

In the root there is also the index.html. Here all the paths to third-party libraries are given (i.e the local libs directory), all RIF specific JavaScript files, css etc. The placeholder for the Angular content is also defined within a div in the html body - "data-ui-view" and also the directive for the notifications bar. Dashboards is further split into five directories, these represent the tabs seen in the RIF GUI, also in the RIF main module, these are the five states defined in the "$stateProvider" (see below). The utils directory has functionality that is shared by more than one of these dashboards, this is mostly to do with mapping of results.

Contained within these directories are separate folders for Angular controllers, directives, partials and services for the relevant part of the RIF.

# The main module

rifm-app: The definition of the RIF angular module. This is where the "$stateProvider" states URLs are defined. These broadly relate to the dashboards selected by the tabs in the main RIF toolbar. All subsequent angular code chains to: angular.module("RIF").

# The UI

For more info on:

* The modal windows: https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/
* The split containers: https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-layout
* The notification bar: https://github.com/alexbeletsky/ng-notifications-bar
* The tables: http://ui-grid.info/
* The maps: http://leafletjs.com/
* The graphs: https://d3js.org/
* Some of the fancy stuff: https://material.angularjs.org/latest/

The RIF specific CSS is a bit of a mess and may have a lot of redundancy. This was inherited from the old RIF prototype. I did not have 
time to go through it properly. How the split containers refresh on resize and on browser resize needs to be looked at. It is either 
jumpy at best, irresponsive at worst. This is probably an issue in ui-layout and not the RIF. Maybe use $timeout to do this.

Alerts are handled in **rifc-util-alert**, which is right up at the root (on the body of index.html) of all the so easily available by 
inheritance to all other controllers/scopes in the RIF. It uses the html attribute: notifications-bar. Some of the errors thrown by the 
middleware can be a bit weird and not informative. Either they should be intercepted by the front-end and a nicer error is broadcast 
by the notifications bar, or the middleware is revisited to provide more human readable error messages.

# The backend

Deals with everything related to the connection with the RIF postgres or sqlserver databases via the Java middleware.

**rifs-back-database**: A service storing which database is being used (postgres or ms sqlserver). This is defined in the rifServces.war 
(resources > properties file) and is therefore not editable from the front-end. This may not be needed in future depending on how the middle ware is refactored, i.e the /ms or /pg may be dropped from the URLs.

**rifs-back-interceptor**: A "$httpInterceptor" service to deal with outgoing RIF specific requests. This checks if a user is logged in and 
checks for a 200 response on return of promise. Handles any problems with the calls.

**rifs-back-requests**: Contains ALL the requests to the middle ware for information from the database for the whole RIF. These return a 
promise (in most cases).

**rifs-back-urls**: Contains the constants for the base URLs to the rifServices. These can be edited here depending on the localhost used. 
See also RIF wiki set up instructions.

# The dashboards

Each dashboard for a user session has its state stored in a service (e.g. **rifs-dmap-mappingstate**). This is a singleton (with closure) and 
is not destroyed during a RIF session. The state service are used to either restore a user's choices on state changes (which destroys 
scope and controllers), but also to restore the RIF defaults if needed. The save/load study functions reads and writes to these singleton 
states.

Each dashboard also has an html partial (e.g. **rifp-dmap-main**) which renders in div defined in index.html with the data-ui-view attribute. 
Changing the tab on the main RIF tab bar changes the state (**rifc-util-tabctrl**) as defined in the module (**rifm-app**).

Each dashboard has a main controller. These are often quite large and could be refactored in the future, in particular there is a lot of 
functionality that could be moved into services. For example, it is not very 'angular' to have code that does not deal directly with the 
UI in the controller. Specific directives usually refer to a unique feature such as a D3 plot (e.g. **rifd-dmap-d3rrzoom**).

Where there is shared functionality between dashboards, this is usually found in the utils directory. For example, choropleth mapping 
(**rifc-util-choro**), basemaps (**rifc-util-basemap**, available maps are defined in **rifs-util-basemap**), notifications (**rifc-util-alert**) etc.

## Login

**rifc-login-login**: Calls the login method for the RIF database. Ensures all states (i.e. previous user inputs) are reset, initialises 
the taxonomy service. On success we transition to "state1", i.e. the submission dashboard. On failure, we remain with the login page.

The logout method (click on the running man on the tool bar) is handled by (**rifc-util-tabctrl**) via a yes/no modal.

## Submission

**rifc-dsub-main**: Initially makes several chained calls to the database to fill all drop-downs etc depending on the user. Once loaded, 
several other controllers are responsible for entering user defined submission data. These all appear in bootstrap modal pop-ups.
Each "tree" has at least its own controller, often multiple controllers.

The results of user selections are stored in the relevant states (see the submission/services). On clicking "Run", we use these states to 
populate a lump of JSON (**rifs-dsub-model**). This JSON object is then posted to the database with the submitStudy method in 
**rifs-back-requests** as submissionFile.txt. No actual calculations are done by the front-end. The save (**rifc-dsub-save**), reset 
(**rifc-dsub-reset**) and open (**rifc-dsub-fromfile**) RIF job methods work with this JSON and the associated state services.

Comparison and Study areas are defined with the same dialog defined by the maptable directive (**rifd-dsub-maptable**) launched by either 
the respective **rifc-dsub-comparea** or **rifc-dsub-studyarea** controllers. See **rifs-dsub-model** for how the areas selected are 
submitted - there is a key for "map_areas" in the JSON object relating to either study area or comparison area, within this an area 
object is stored with attributes: id, gid, label and band (for risk analysis). 

So far this band attribute is not used as risk analysis cannot be done by the RIF backend yet. **rifs-dsub-model** also contains slots 
that vary depending if the study type is disease mapping or risk analysis (disease_mapping_study, risk_analysis_study). As risk mapping 
has not been done yet, how the two different study types are recognised may need to be thought through again. The database cannot 
handle "risk_analysis_study" and will throw an error. All this depends on how risk analysis will be handled in the db and middle ware.

Using rifd-dsub-maptable, areas can be selected at the required resolution, 

* By clicking on the table or map (synced with a $watchCollection)
* By drawing polygons and concentric circles (uses the LeafletDraw library modified in **rifs-util-leafletdraw** to broadcast on 
  *$rootScope*)
* By uploading a csv list of districts in the format: [ID, band] (**rifc-dsub-idlist**)
* By selecting with a zipped shapefile (see **rifd-dsub-risk**). Various methods are possible; defining buffers around a point file, defining
  selection by polygon extent, defining selection by polygon attribute.
* Note that selection based on shapefile/polygon overlay is determined on the basis of intersection with the districts centroid and the 
  overlay. Essentially a simple point-in-polygon test: **rifs-util-gis**.
* Study area for risk analysis allows 1:6 bands, disease mapping just one band. Comparison areas always only allow one band. There is 
  still some discussion on standard ways to select risk analysis areas as "in the old RIF", so some new selection functionality may 
  need to be added.
* Methods to select layers will be refined once we have some user feedback

Investigation parameters is where the taxonomy service is used. This is a standalone service due to copyright issues with the ICD10 codes 
(we cannot distribute this on github). ICD10 is the only services available - more taxonomies are planned to be incorporated. This is a 
very basic dialog, in future it should be adapted to handle multiple covariates, set lists of ICD codes and multiple investigations. 
Again, several calls are made to the middle ware (in **rifc-dsub-params**) to fill the drop-downs and results are saved in 
**rifs-dsub-paramstate** for submission. This part of the front-end will probably need the most work after the backend and middle ware 
are updated.

Statistical methods (**rifc-dsub-stats**) selects which smoothing method to run. Possible methods are defined in the middleware (not 
hard-typed). So far we have HET, BYM, CAR and none. It is also possible to store parameters for the model, but this is not used at the 
moment.

Prior to submission, we can get an HTML formatted summary of the RIF job (**rifc-dsub-summary**) using the tags in **rifc-dsub-model** 
area table function. The model here is of JSON structure and is posted as a text file. To get the structure of this, use the 'save' 
option on the GUI to download a current job as a .json file. I do not see this model json structure having to change in future RIF 
development.

On submission, the job is run in the database behind the scenes. Clicking status (**rifc-dsub-status**) gives the status for a user's 
RIF jobs. Status is also checked every 4 seconds to give a notification of completion of any pending jobs (this is done in by the tab 
controller **rifc-util-tabctrl**)

## Mapping and Viewer

These dashboards are very similar so will be explained together. During development, I could not get a straight answer as to what the 
difference with these should be and what actually is required, the two-tab approach is directly taken from Fred Fabbri's initial 
prototype. Hopefully with some user feedback, the functionality of these should be refined. 

The main difference is that the viewer allows a map and table view, while the mapper allows two maps and focuses on "bow-tie" plots of 
risks. Both allow choropleth mapping (**rifc-util-choro**) and changeable basemaps in Leaflet (**rifc-util-basemap**). Mapping and Viewer 
dashboards have their own main controllers (**rifc-dmap-main** and **rifc-view-viewer**), but the mapping itself is governed by the 
**rifc-util-mapping** controller as functionality is shared. The appropriate Leaflet container (div) is referenced as either 
"diseasemap1", "diseasemap2" or "viewermap".

Polygons are served up in topoJSON tiles as created by Peter's tilemaker as an *L.topoJsonGridLayer*. This is very similar to handling 
normal geoJSON, just the call to the middle ware must be defined correctly: getTileMakerTiles. Once loaded, the tiled layer behaves as 
any geoJSON in Leaflet.

There are a selection of mapping and selection tools as directives, see **rifd-util-leafletTools**. There are also tools to save the 
D3 plots to png (**rifd-util-savechart**). There exists a directive to save the Leaflet map with overlays in **rifd-util-leafletTools** 
(leafletToPng). This does not work very well and is inconsistent between browsers, it will need looking at. I think that it should 
actually be removed in favour of the export tools (explained later) or prompting the user to go full screen and use the screen dump 
(Print Scrn button) to clipboard.

(Note that the directive used for the map area submissions, **rifd-dsub-maptable** duplicates a lot of the functionality used here. 
It was always the intention to refactor **rifd-dsub-maptable** to be more consistent with **rifc-util-mapping** and its associated 
directives). 

All D3 plots are dealt with using directives to define a new HTML element. Note that these still need wrapping in a *$watch* to allow 
them to refresh. Capturing the keyboard events in angular for multiple maps and D3 graphs was quite challenging, there may still be bugs 
here.

The processed study being mapped are selected via the drop-downs. There is an info button next to these to display study details 
(**rifd-util-info**). This needs some work still on the back-end as not all of the relevant information is stored and/or retrieved, 
see the method getDetailsForProcessedStudy.

Choropleth mapping uses colour scales defined by colorbrewer.org (**rifs-util-colorbrewer**). Category definitions follow the usual 
methods; equal interval, quantile etc (**rifs-util-choro**). The code to do the rendering is a bit messy and could do with a tidy 
(**rifc-util-choro**)

## Export

To get all the results out of the RIF in a zip file (**rifc-expt-export**). All the zipping etc. is done in the middle ware. So far this 
exports the map table (RIF results) and the extract table (data used by the RIF to make the results) as csv files. The study and 
comparison areas are also exported as geoJSON files (text, can be loaded into any GIS and converted to a shapefile). Other tables could 
be exported here too, e.g. a formatted table for input to SatScan.

This dashboard also allows a quick preview of the data and the map areas. This would need modification after user feedback.

After user testing, there will be loads of requests as to what needs to be outputted ("what-the-old-RIF-did" etc. etc.)
