# 1. Overview

This document details the loading of the administrative geography data and the geo-coding requirements of the RIF. 

The RIF web front end uses [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/), which requires map tiles; these are squares that follow certain Google Maps conventions:

* Tiles are 256x256 pixels;
* At the outer most zoom level, 0, the entire world can be rendered in a single map tile;
* Each [zoom level](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Zoom_levels) doubles in both dimensions, so a single tile is replaced by 4 tiles when zooming in. This 
  means that about 22 zoom levels are sufficient for most practical purposes; the RIF uses 0-11;
* The Web Mercator ([WGS84](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System), as used by GPS) projection is used, with latitude limits of around 85 degrees. Care 
  needs to be taken during simplification with 
  Northern latitudes in the USA because of the distortions in the Mercator projection (e.g. the size of Greenland); with each pixel being much shorter in
  length than in latitudes near to the equator.
  
Leaflet uses de facto OpenStreetMap standard, known as [Slippy Map Tilenames](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames) or XYZ, follows these and adds more:

* An X and Y numbering scheme; with Z for the zoomlevels;
* PNG images for tiles. In the RIF Leaflet also uses topoJSON tles for the administrative geography.

Background map images are served direct from the source through a REST API, with a URL like ```http://.../Z/X/Y.png``` where Z is the zoom level, and X and Y identify the tile. 

For example a zoomlevel 8 tile, X=123, Y=82; covering the Irish Sea, Liverpool and the Lancashire and Cumbrian coasts:
![alt text](http://a.tile.openstreetmap.org/8/125/82.png "Zoomlevel 8, X=123, Y=82; Irish Sea, Liverpool and the Lancashire and Cumbrian coasts")
 
The RIF does *NOT* cache background maps so on a private air-gapped network you will not get background maps. 

The administrative geography
uses [GeoJSON Layers](https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.3.0.html#geojson) server by the *rifServices* REST api. 
For performance reasons the RIF uses a modified 
[Leaflet.GeoJSONGridLayer](https://github.com/ebrelsford/leaflet-geojson-gridlayer) originally created by 
Eric Brelsford. The modification is to use TopoJSON grids to reduce the REST GET JSON size
and then internally converts to TopoJSON to GeoJSON for the Leaflet gridlayer. Some experiments have been 
carried out with local caching and there is a tile viewer program to test this.

The caching code is in the main RIF application but is disabled due to issues with browser support.

The job of the Tile Maker is to process a hierarchy of administrative shapefiles to:

* Generate the TopoJSON tiles required by the RIF and store them in the database;
* Generate the required data tables, scripts and setup data for a RIF administrative geography;
* Provide installer scripts for both Postgres and SQL Server.

Performance:

* SAHSULAND takes about 15 minutes to processing in total.
* USA to county level with only 9 zoomlevels:
  * Shapefile conversion and simplification: 115s.
  * Database load/clean etc: 1 hour 27 minutes
  * Tile manufacture: 5290 tiles in 2 hours  48 minutes
  About 5 hours in total.

The principal limitation is memory:
 
* UK Census output area 2011 is 1GB in size and has 227,759 records and 203,930,998 points! 
* This requires a machine with 32 or 63G memory.
* A pre-simplification program will be created to reduce the resolution suitably.

## 1.1 Software Requirements

* [Node.js 8](https://nodejs.org/en/);
* [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2714/);
* GNU Make (part of [Mingw](http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Getting_Started) MSYS on Windows) [Optional];
* Postgres 9.3 onwards and/or SQL Server 2012 onwards;

The software has not been tested on Linux or MacOS but should work.

## 1.2 Issues

### 1.2.1 Memory Requirements

A minimum of 16GB of RAM is required; if you are processing high resolution geographies (e.g. US census 
block groups or UK census output areas) you will require 32 to 64GB of RAM.

The memory requirement comes from the need to read an entire shapefile, convert each area to [GeoJson](http://geojson.org/), and finally progressively simplify the GeoJSON to be 
suitable for each zoomlevel.  

By default the *TileMaker* runs in only 4GB memory which is not enough for large shapefiles. 

In particular see [2.3.3 Handling Large Shapefiles](https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility/blob/master/rifNodeServices/tileMaker.md#233-handling-large-shapefiles) to
either reduce the memory requirement or increase the available memory.

### 1.2.2 SQL Server Connection Error

Symptom; SQL Severer connect error ```Error: None of the binaries loaded successfully. Is your node version either >= 0.12.7 or >= 4.2.x or >= 5.1.1 or >= 6.1.0```

* SQL server connect error caused by a version mismatch between the Node.js packages *mssql* and *msnodesqlv8*;

* Check you have [Visual Studio 2015/2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) installed; launch it and logon to the Microsoft DEveloper network so the developer license is active;
* Remove *mssql* and *msnodesqlv8* from *package.json*;
* re-run: ```npm install msnodesqlv8 --save```:
  ```

Ypou must install a version 2.6.N JSZip: ```npm install JSZip@2.6.1```

If you get:

```
C:\Users\Peter\Documents\GitHub\rapidInquiryFacility\rifNodeServices>npm install JSZip@2.6.1
RIF40-geospatial@0.0.1 C:\Users\Peter\Documents\GitHub\rapidInquiryFacility\rifNodeServices
`-- jszip@2.6.1  invalid
```
Chnage the *package.json line from the version 3 JSZip to the 2.6.N version:
```
    "jszip": "^2.6.1",
```
The code does need to be updated to version 3.

A correct install looks like:
```
C:\Users\Peter\Documents\GitHub\rapidInquiryFacility\rifNodeServices>npm install JSZip@2.6.1
RIF40-geospatial@0.0.1 C:\Users\Peter\Documents\GitHub\rapidInquiryFacility\rifNodeServices

```

### 1.2.4 BULK INSERT Permission

SQL Server needs access permission granted to the directories used to `BULK INSERT` files, the files are not copied from the client to the 
server as in the *Postgres* *psql* ```\copy` command and the *Oracle* *sqlldr* command.

SQL Server needs access to the directories containing the data loaded by the scripts. The simplest
way is to allow read/execute access to the local users group (e.g. PH-LAPTOP\Users or USERS depending on your Windows version).

*DO NOT TRY TO RUN BULK INSERT FROM NETWORK DRIVES or CLOUD DRIVES (e.g. Google Drive).* Use a local directory which SQL Server has
access to; e.g. somewhere on the C: drive. Note that SQL Server *BULK LOAD* behaves deterrently if you logon using Windows authentication (where it will use your credentials 
to access the files) to using a username and password (where it will use the Server's credentials to access the file).

```
-- SQL statement 23: Load table from CSV file >>>
BULK INSERT cb_2014_us_county_500k
FROM 'C:\Users\Peter\OneDrive\SEER Data\Tile maker USA/cb_2014_us_county_500k.csv'	-- Note use of pwd; set via -v pwd="%cd%" in the sqlcmd command line

);

```

### 1.2.5 MSSQL Timeout: Request failed to complete in XXX000ms

Timeout in Node [mssql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mssql) package. Edit *mssqlTileMaker.js*  and set
the the requestTomeout in the MSSQL connection config:

```js
	var config = {

		requestTimeout: 300000, // 5 mins. Default 15s per SQL statement
		options: {
			trustedConnection: false,
			useUTC: true,
			appName: 'mssqlTileMaker.js',
			encrypt: true
		}
	};
```

By default the *TileMaker* runs in only 4GB memory which is not enough for large shapefiles. 
See [2.3.3 Handling Large Shapefiles](https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility/blob/master/rifNodeServices/tileMaker.md#233-handling-large-shapefiles) to either
reduce the memory requirement or increase the available memory.

The transaction BEGIN/END statements had already been removed from *pg_EWS2011.sql* so that the previous objects up to and including the hierarchy table were committed.

Hierarchy insert took 83 minutes. Two rows are missing from the hierarchy are:
```
sahsuland_dev=> SELECT coa2011 FROM lookup_coa2011
sahsuland_dev->                 EXCEPT 
sahsuland_dev->                 SELECT coa2011 FROM hierarchy_ews2011;
  coa2011

```

These are in Cardiff and are small:

That COA2011 only is affected means that the upper intersections are fine.

The hierarchy check failure may have been caused by oversimplification of higher layers (SCNTRY, CNTRY) leading to the exclusion to the two census output areas.:

* CNTRY2011 in purple;
* GOR2011 (not oversimplified) in green;
* COA2001 in hashing;

![alt text](https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility/blob/master/rifNodeServices/cardiff_COA_issue.png?raw=true "Cardiff COA2001 issue map")
To be in the hierarchy the intersection code *insert_hierarchy.sql* selects the intersection with the largest intersection by area for each (higher resolution). This 
eliminates duplicates and picks the most likely intersection on the basis of area. There are two possible reasons for this failure:

* An intersection was not found. **Visually this appears to be the case**;
* The area is zero. This seems unlikely and would need to be tested in SQL.

The following SQL was derived from code generated by *insert_hierarchy.sql*:

```

This, unsurprisingly, returned no rows, suggesting the problem is with the intersection and not the area:
```
  scntry2011 | cntry2011 | gor2011 | ladua2011 | msoa2011 | lsoa2011 | coa2011 | test12 | max12 | test23 | max23 | test34 | max34 | test45 | max45 | test56 | max56 | test67 | max67
 ------------+-----------+---------+-----------+----------+----------+---------+--------+-------+--------+-------+--------+-------+--------+-------+--------+-------+--------+-------
 (0 rows)

```
This in turn implies the problem may be with the COA2011, LSOA2011 intersection, common table expression: *x67*; as shown by the below map. The records will be manually inserted to fix the problem.
![alt text](https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility/blob/master/rifNodeServices/cardiff_COA_issue2.png?raw=true "Cardiff COA2001 intersection issue map")

The following Postgres SQL was added to *pg_EWS2011.sql* immediately after the hierarchy insert.

```SQL
WITH a AS (
	SELECT DISTINCT scntry2011,cntry2011, gor2011, ladua2011, msoa2011, lsoa2011
	  FROM hierarchy_ews2011
	 WHERE lsoa2011 = 'W01001945' /* Where it should be */
), b AS (
	SELECT coa2011, lsoa11_1
      FROM coa2011
     WHERE coa2011 IN ('W00010143', 'W00010161') 
)
INSERT INTO hierarchy_ews2011 (scntry2011, cntry2011, gor2011, ladua2011, msoa2011, lsoa2011, coa2011)
SELECT a.*, b.coa2011
  FROM a, b
 WHERE a.lsoa2011 = b.lsoa11_1
   AND b.coa2011 NOT IN (SELECT coa2011 FROM hierarchy_ews2011);   
```

The SQL Server SQL code will be the same.

This can also be added to *geoDataLoader.xml* just below the top level ```<geoDataLoader>```:
```
  <hierarchy_post_processing_sql>
    <![CDATA[
WITH a AS (
	SELECT DISTINCT scntry2011,cntry2011, gor2011, ladua2011, msoa2011, lsoa2011
	  FROM hierarchy_ews2011
	 WHERE lsoa2011 = 'W01001945' /* Where it should be */
), b AS (
	SELECT coa2011, lsoa11_1
      FROM coa2011
     WHERE coa2011 IN ('W00010143', 'W00010161') /* Missing */
)
INSERT INTO hierarchy_ews2011 (scntry2011, cntry2011, gor2011, ladua2011, msoa2011, lsoa2011, coa2011)
SELECT a.*, b.coa2011
  FROM a, b
 WHERE a.lsoa2011 = b.lsoa11_1
   AND b.coa2011 NOT IN (SELECT coa2011 FROM hierarchy_ews2011)
   ]]>
  </hierarchy_post_processing_sql> 
```
This SQL will then be inserted just after *insert_hierarchy.sql* and before the checks. The SQL should be in a CDATA block and should **NOT** have a terminating comma.

### 1.2.10 SQL Server disk space and memory Issues

Large database post processing can easily fill up the database and exhaust the memory. SQL Server does not release memory willingly and database compaction (*shrinking*) 
has to be done manually.

* If the database runs out of space; shrink it: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/databases/shrink-a-database?view=sql-server-2017
* ```The app domain with specified version id (2) was unloaded due to memory pressure and could not be found```
 * Stop and start SQL Server to release memory
 
It is advised to do this before any big run.
 
# 2. Running the Tile Maker

## 2.1 Setup

Install the required *Node.js* modules. Change directory into the *rapidInquiryFacility\rifNodeServices*:

```
cd C:\Users\phamb\Documents\GitHub\rapidInquiryFacility\rifNodeServices
make
```

If you do not have make, type:

```
mkdir node_modules/pg-native
npm install --save pg-native
npm install JSZip@2.6.0
npm install --save request JSZip turf geojson2svg clone object-sizeof form-data magic-globals helmet pg pg-native mssql msnodesqlv8 srs xml2js async reproject mapshaper forever shapefile node-uuid chroma-js jszip express morgan topojson request-debug cjson wellknown svg2png svg2png-many connect-busboy winston
```

To update the modules type ```npm update --save```.

The tile Maker is a web application, so you need to start the server. The Makefile has a number of targets to help with this:

- all: Build modules, run the complete database test harness
- modules: Build required Node.js modules using npm install --save to update dependencies in package.json
- clean: clean Node modules; avoid Windows path length stupidities with rimraf
- install:  No install target (dummy)
- server-start: start server
- server-restart: restart server
- server-restart-debug: restart server with debugging
- server-status: status of running server
- server-stop: stop server
- server-log: display server logs
- test\make_bighelloworld.js: create >2G data\bighelloworld.js
- update: Update required Node.js modules using npm install --save to update dependencies in package.json
- test: Run the test harness
- help: Display makefile help, rifNode.js help

Again, these commands can be run by hand; 

- Start:
  ```
  rm -f forever.err forever.log
  node node_modules\forever\bin\forever start -c "node --max-old-space-size=4096 --expose-gc" -verbose -l forever.log -e forever.err -o forever.log --append ./expressServer.js
  ```
- Stop:
  ```
  node node_modules\forever\bin\forever stop -verbose -l forever.log -e forever.err -o forever.log --append ./expressServer.js
  ```
- Restart:
  ```
  rm -f forever.err forever.log
  node node_modules\forever\bin\forever stop -verbose -l forever.log -e forever.err -o forever.log --append ./expressServer.js
  node node_modules\forever\bin\forever start -c "node --max-old-space-size=4096 --expose-gc" -verbose -l forever.log -e forever.err -o forever.log --append ./expressServer.js
  ```

Stop example:  
```
C:\Users\phamb\Documents\GitHub\rapidInquiryFacility\rifNodeServices>make server-start
Debug level set to default: 1
node_modules\\forever\\bin\\forever start -c "node --max-old-space-size=4096 --expose-gc" -verbose -l forever.log -e forever.err -o forever.log --append ./expressServer.js

warn:    --spinSleepTime not set. Your script will exit if it does not stay up for at least 1000ms
info:    Forever processing file: ./expressServer.js
```

Stop example:
```
C:\Users\phamb\Documents\GitHub\rapidInquiryFacility\rifNodeServices>  node node_modules\forever\bin\forever stop -verbose -l forever.log -e forever.err -o forever.log --append ./expressServer.js

```

Finally, start the *tile maker* application in a browser [http://127.0.0.1:3000/tile-maker.html](http://127.0.0.1:3000/tile-maker.html)
![alt text](https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility/blob/master/rifNodeServices/tile_maker_start.PNG?raw=true "Tile Maker Start Screen")

The following browsers have been tested:

* Chrome;
* Mozilla Firefox [recommended as it handles large memory requirements well];
* Internet Explorer 11 [not recommended as it is very bad at handling large memory requirements];
* Microsoft Edge

## 2.2 Processing Overview

GUI phase:

1. The *tile maker* web application is used to upload and convert shapefiles and simplifies the GeoJSON 
   geometry. The web application generates scripts and the *tile maker* configuration file: *geoDataLoader.xml*;
2. The user then downloads the processed data from server;

GUI phase then proceeds to script phase:

3. Run a SQL script. This loads the processed CSV data into the database (both Postgres and SQL Server are supported). The data is then cleaned and processed by the script into geospatial 
   data tables, data for tiles and the hierarchy and lookup tables needed by the RIF;
4. A tile manufacture node script is then run. This makes the topoJSON tiles; dumps geospatial table data to CSV files for the load scripts.
5. The RIF production load SQL script can now be run. This script loads and configure the geospatial data into your RIF database;
6. You can view the tiles using the *tile viewer* application.

The first load/clean/setup SQL script and the tile maker will be integrated into the web services at a later date. All the processing will then be in the front end and this leaves 
the user only needing to install the processed data into the database.

Processing concepts:

* Geography: The name of an administrative geography; e.g. USA_2014, EW_2001 (the 2011 census for England 
  and Wales);
* Geolevel: The name of a level in the hierarchy of shapefiles that make up the geography;
* Area ID: A code given to an area ID by the administrative authority (e.g. ONS for the 2011 Census);
* Area Name: A name corresponding to an *area ID*. 

## 2.3 Running the Front End

The *tile maker* web application is used to:

1. Upload a set of shapefiles (see next section for format), this optionally contains the *tile maker* 
   configuration file: *geoDataLoader.xml*. The field names must be in upper case. For first run through setup:
   
   * Enter a geography name and description;
   * For each administrative geography starting from the highest resolution:
     * Enter a description;
     * Select an *Area_ID* from the list of features in the shapefile. This will be the name of column used throughout the administrative geography and must be distinct; 
     * Enter a description for the *Area_id*;
     * Select an *Area_Name* from the list of features in the shapefile; 
     * Enter a description for the *Area_Name*;
   * When setup the user presses the **Upload file(s)** button. You then get a lot of processing messages.
   
   The descriptions may be pre-entered  for you if you have an ESRI extended attributes file (.shp.ea.iso.xml)
   
   ![alt text](https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility/blob/master/rifNodeServices/sahsuland_setup.PNG?raw=true "SAHSUland setup")

   So as a worked example for the United States to county level:
   
   * Geography name: USA_2014;
   * Description: US 2014 Census geography to county level;
   * Shapefile: cb_2014_us_nation_5m.shp:
     * Description: The nation at a scale of 1:5,000,000;
     * Area_ID: GEOID - Nation identifier;
	 * Area_Name: NAME - Nation name;
   * Shapefile: cb_2014_us_state_500k.shp:
     * Description: The State at a scale of 1:500,000;
     * Area_ID: STATENS - Current state Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) code;
	 * Area_Name: NAME - Current State name;
   * Shapefile: cb_2014_us_county_500k.shp:
     * Description: The County at a scale of 1:500,000;
     * Area_ID: COUNTYNS - Current county Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) code;
	 * Area_Name: NAME - Current county name;
   
   ![alt text](https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility/blob/master/rifNodeServices/USA_county_setup.PNG?raw=true "USA County setup")
  
   Note that you can also change:
   
   * The quantization. To be able to simplify the geoJSON the data must be quantized. The default is 
     1:1,000,000. This means that the smallest value is 1 millionth of the largest value. You will need to 
	 increase this quantization to 1:10,000,000 or 1:100,000,000 if you use more than 11 zoom levels or you cover are 
	 very large area. Quantization is applied on a per shapefile basis so there is no potential for slivers between areas.
	 However, if the shapefiles are not on the same scale (as in the US data) then you will see differences between 
	 the national data at 1:5,000,000 and the state and county data at 1:500,000;
   * The simplification factor. The *tile maker* uses Visvalingam algorithm 
     [Line generalisation by repeated elimination of the smallest area; Visvalingam, Maheswari; Whyatt, J. D. (James Duncan)Cartography -- Data processing; Computer science; July 1992](https://hydra.hull.ac.uk/resources/hull:8338)
     This is superior to the Ramer–Douglas–Peucker algorithm generally leaving no "cocked hat" artefacts. The 
	 effect of this parameter can be seen at [Mike Bostock's Line Simplification Example](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/simplify/)
	 Set a low value (e.g. 0.3) will result in modern art (i.e. triangles). Generally it needs to be increased slightly from the default (0.75)
	 for large areas and high resolutions to improve quality. This is especially true if you have high latitudes in your map 
	 and the mercator distortions are greater;
   * Maximum zoomlevel. The default is 11; reducing to 9 will reduce the processing time by a factor of 16. Every 
     increase quadruples processing time. !1 gives good quality even with fine census tracts/output areas.
   * Enables more diagnostics in the log
 
   The web application then:
   
   2. Converts the shapefiles to first GeoJSON the TopoJSON format in the WGS84 projection;
   3. Simplifies the GeoJSON geometry using the *Visvalingam* algorithm;
   4. Generates SQL scripts and the *tile maker* configuration file: *geoDataLoader.xml*;

   Informative message appear at the bottom of the screen:
   ![alt text](https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility/blob/master/rifNodeServices/tile_maker_processing.PNG?raw=true "Tile maker processing messages")
    
   Tile maker processing messages are also found in the *forever.err* log, e.g:
   
   * ```Processed zip file 1: SAHSULAND.zip; size: 6.73MB; added: 33 file(s)```
   * ```SAHSU_GRD_Level4: simplified topojson for zoomlevel: 7```
   * ```Created database load scripts: pg_SAHSULAND.sql and mssql_SAHSULAND.sql```

   Finally a map is displayed of the adminstrative geography:

5. The user then downloads the processed data from server using the two download buttons in the *shapefile 
   selector* tab. The *Download configuration" button returns an XML file e.g. 
   *shpConvertGetConfig_66d8a532-bb2c-4304-8e2b-ffde330b88fa.xml*; this is the *geoDataLoader.xml* for the run.

   The *Download processed files* button is currently not worked ans the underlying ZIP file is **NOT**
   implemented and it will produce an error:

   * *status.json*: processing statii in JSON format.
   
### 2.3.1 Shapefile Format

The best approach is to have each administrative geography in your hierarchy as single ZIP file containing a set of shapefiles. The tile maker requires two or more shapefiles with:

* A shapefile (.shp). This contains the geometric data in a proprietary ESRI format;
* dBASE III/IV file (.dbf). The contains the attributes records for each area in a dBASE table;
* An ESRI projection file (.prj). You must have a projection file, use: http://spatialreference.org/ to search for it.
  Using *OSGB* as the search term returns the UK national grid http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/4277/. You
  can then download the relevant .prj file. This actually only contains the ESRI WKT (wellknown text):
  ```
  GEOGCS["OSGB 1936",DATUM["D_OSGB_1936",SPHEROID["Airy_1830",6377563.396,299.3249646]],PRIMEM["Greenwich",0],UNIT["Degree",0.017453292519943295]]
  ```

There is a one-to-one relationship between geometry and attributes, which is based on record number. Attribute records in the dBASE file must be in the same order as records in the main file.

Optional files:

* Tile maker configuration file: *geoDataLoader.xml*. This contains the setup for your hierarchy and can be downloaded after your run;
* ESRI extended attributes XML file for a shapefile (.shp.ea.iso.xml). The contains principally the names of the attributes and their description.

Other files not required by the tile Maker:

* .shx — The index file that stores the index of the feature geometry; only required by ARCGIS;
* .sbn and .sbx — The files that store the spatial index of the features;
* .fbn and .fbx — The files that store the spatial index of the features for shapefiles that are read-only;
* .ain and .aih — The files that store the attribute index of the active fields in a table or a theme's attribute table;
* .atx — An .atx file is created for each shapefile or dBASE attribute index created in ArcCatalog. ArcView GIS 3.x attribute indexes for shapefiles and dBASE files are not used by ArcGIS. 
   A new attribute indexing model has been developed for shapefiles and dBASE files;
* .ixs — Geocoding index for read/write shapefiles;
* .mxs — Geocoding index for read/write shapefiles (ODB format);
* .cpg — An optional file that can be used to specify the codepage for identifying the character-set to be used.

The usual layout for the tilemaker ZIP file is:

-  *geoDataLoader.xml* [not needed first time around; generated by the *tile maker* web application]
- Directory containing the shapefiles. These *may* be contained in sub-directories:
  ![alt text](https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility/blob/master/rifNodeServices/zip_file_structure_1.PNG?raw=true "ZIP file base directory")
  - The shapefiles themselves:
    ![alt text](https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility/blob/master/rifNodeServices/zip_file_structure_2.PNG?raw=true "ZIP file directory containing the shapefiles")

This allows the *tile maker* runs to be re-produced exactly.

Make sure you:

* **Follow the ESRI naming convention exactly**;
* **Do **NOT** use the same file name in multiple sub-directories** or you will get:
  ```
  Unable to process list of filess
  Duplicate file: sahsu_grd_level1.dbf; shape file: sahsu_grd_level1.shp already processed
  ```
* **Have a top level shapefile with only one area**;
* **Do not add extra files other than those specified here. For example a Windows batch script used to pre process the shapefiles will cause an error**;
* **Follow the Shapefile Naming Requirements**.

### 2.3.2 Shapefile Naming Requirements

The *AreaID* field will be the name of column used throughout the administrative geography and must be:

* Distinct between shapefiles. DO *NOT* call them all *area_id* or *geo_code*;
* In upper case. Using lower case names will result in a crash!
* Do not add files not defined here to the ZIP file. This will cause:
  ```
  FAIL Shapefile[7/7/tileMaker]:
  tileMaker.bat is missing a shapefile/DBF file/Projection file
  ```

See the [2.4.3 Renaming fields in a shapefile](https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility/blob/master/rifNodeServices/tileMaker.md#243-renaming-fields-in-a-shapefile) 
example below.

The file name of the ZIP file is the code for the geography. This can be changed in the front end. 

### 2.3.3 Handling Large Shapefiles

Large shapefiles are those bigger than 500MB in size or with more than 100,000 records. The England, Wales and Scotland 2011 census has census output area as it highest resolution 
with 227,759 feature and is 1.04GB in size. Pre-processing to reduce the shapefile size by 80% reduces this to 240MB with acceptable loss in quality. The maximum zoomlevel can 
easily be set to 9, this removes two simplification passes with no reduction in overall quality. This will also speed up the SQL post processing by a factor of 16. 

In the England, Wales and Scotland 2011 census there a four further levels with increasing administrative boundary size to (Government office) region; and a sixth highest level of country. 

A key factor is visualizing a suitable amount of initial simplification using the mapshaper GUI, see: 
[pre processing shapefiles](https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility/blob/master/rifNodeServices/tileMaker.md#24-pre-processing-shapefiles):

* England Wales and Scotland at Census Output area, unsimplified. The orange lines and points are polygon errors (line intersections):
  ![alt text](https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility/blob/master/rifNodeServices/EWS2011_COA_unsimplified.PNG?raw=true "England Wales and Scotland at Census Output area, unsimplified")

* Simplified by 50%:
  ![alt text](https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility/blob/master/rifNodeServices/EWS2011_COA_50pct_simplified.PNG?raw=true "Simplified by 50%")

* Simplified by 80%:
  ![alt text](https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility/blob/master/rifNodeServices/EWS2011_COA_80pct_simplified.PNG?raw=true "Simplified by 80%")

* Simplified by 90%:
  ![alt text](https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility/blob/master/rifNodeServices/EWS2011_COA_90pct_simplified.PNG?raw=true "Simplified by 90%")

* Simplified by 99.999%:
  ![alt text](https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility/blob/master/rifNodeServices/EWS2011_COA_99_999pct_simplified.PNG?raw=true "Simplified by 99.999%")

These leads to the following conclusions:

* 99.999% simplification is far too much as the shapes are starting to break down;
* 50% simplification is still very high quality with little visible loss of information at the scales the RIF maps at;
* 80% simplification is acceptable, there is some visible loss of information in urban areas, suitable for most RIF users;
* 90% simplification is borderline, there is visible loss of information in urban areas. Suitable for regional or state boundaries provided they are not too small;
* 98% simplification is poor at high scale. Suitable for boundary maps, e.g. UK and UK constituent countries;

After shapefile reduction by 80% the total size of all the files in the administrative geography is 480MB. This is a simplification factor of 0.8. Fine tuning lead to 
98% simplification for boundary maps, e.g. UK and UK constituent countries.

Take care to ensure the the input shapefile is valid (i.e. use the ```-clean``` flag in *mapshaper*); and keep the boundary maps simple. If they are mapped at high scale 
they tend to contain many small islands which can become invalid during simplification. These take a long time to fix; for the UK no pre-simplification took two hours to 
fix, 98% simplification took 7 seconds!

The Node.js server program needs to be able to read each shapefile in turn and then store the GeoJSON in memory. This leads to a memory requirement of 40x the total size of the shapefiles with 
a maximum zoomlevel of 9.

The server is pre-configured with 4GB of memory in the *Makefile*. To change the memory in use alter *NODE_MAX_MEMORY=* to the new value in MB: ```NODE_MAX_MEMORY?=24576```. The 
```?``` is important, it allows the value to be set without altering the Makefile. There are four ways to achieve this:

1. Altering the Makefile:
  ```Makefile
  NODE_MAX_MEMORY?=24576
  FOREVER_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=$(NODE_MAX_MEMORY) --expose-gc
  ```
2. Set *NODE_MAX_MEMORY* in the environment;
3. Use ```make server-start NODE_MAX_MEMORY=24576``` to set on the command line. This will work for the other stop/restart make targets;
4. Manual start - change ```--max-old-space-size=4096``` to ```--max-old-space-size=24576```:
  ```
  rm -f forever.err forever.log
  node node_modules\forever\bin\forever start -c "node --max-old-space-size=24576 --expose-gc" -verbose -l forever.log -e forever.err -o forever.log --append ./expressServer.js
  ```
  
## 2.4 Pre Processing Shapefiles

Huge shapefiles need to be pre processed using *mapshaper* down to a more reasonable size. *mapshaper* has browser and command line based versions and handles large files well.
Do *NOT* use the web based version [http://mapshaper.org/](http://mapshaper.org/) as it is limited to 100MB.

Install [mapshaper](https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper) globally using ```npm install -g mapshaper```:
```
C:\Users\phamb\Documents\GitHub\rapidInquiryFacility>npm install -g mapshaper
C:\Users\phamb\AppData\Roaming\npm\mapshaper -> C:\Users\phamb\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\mapshaper\bin\mapshaper
C:\Users\phamb\AppData\Roaming\npm\mapshaper-xl -> C:\Users\phamb\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\mapshaper\bin\mapshaper-xl
C:\Users\phamb\AppData\Roaming\npm\mapshaper-gui -> C:\Users\phamb\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\mapshaper\bin\mapshaper-gui
+ mapshaper@0.4.80
added 17 packages in 2.913s
```
On Windows there are two commands available:

* Command line: ```C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\npm\mapshaper-gui.cmd```
* Browser GUI: ```C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\npm\mapshaper.cmd```

*mapshaper* is a complex tool with many options [mapshaper WIKI](https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper/wiki). In addition to simplification:
 
* Convert between file formats;
* Clip a layer of polygons, lines or points using polygons in a second layer;
* Erase parts of a polygon, line or point layer using a second polygon layer;
* Aggregate polygons by dissolving edges;
* Join an external data table to a feature layer;
* Edit the attribute table;
* Create population weighted centroids.

Other tools available are:

* [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/). QGIS can load and simplify shapefiles;
* [ArcGIS](https://www.arcgis.com/features/index.html). The most complete all round solution; but requires expensive licensing.

The following *mapshaper* options were used:

* [```<shapefile>``` or ```-i <shapefile>```](https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper/wiki/Command-Reference#-i-input): Input shapefile name;
  * ```snap```: Input shapefile option - snap together vertices within a small distance threshold. This option is intended to fix minor coordinate misalignments in adjacent polygons. 
    The snapping distance is 0.0025 of the average segment length;
* [```-simplify <simplify percent> stats```](https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper/wiki/Command-Reference#-simplify): Simplify retaining %lt;simplify percent&gt; of the data. 20% to 50% 
  gives good results; less than 5% will probably result in triangles. This is very dependent on the resolution of the shapefile. Mapshaper supports 
  Douglas-Peucker simplification and two kinds of Visvalingam simplification. Douglas-Peucker (a.k.a. Ramer-Douglas-Peucker) produces simplified lines that remain within a specified 
  distance of the original line. It is effective for thinning dense vertices but tends to form spikes at high simplification.
  Visvalingam simplification iteratively removes the least important point from a polyline. The importance of points is measured using a metric based on the geometry of the triangle 
  formed by each non-endpoint vertex and the two neighboring vertices. The visvalingam option uses the "effective area" metric — points forming smaller-area triangles are removed first.
  Mapshaper's default simplification method uses Visvalingam simplification but weights the effective area of each point so that smaller-angle vertices are preferentially removed, 
  resulting in a smoother appearance. Display summary statistics relating to the geometry of simplified paths;
* [```-o <output shapefile or output directory>```](https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper/wiki/Command-Reference#-o-output): Output shapefile or output directory;
  * ```format=shapefile|geojson|topojson|json|dbf|csv|tsv|svg```: Output option - format as a shapefile|geojson|topojson|json|dbf|csv|tsv|svg; 
  * ```name=<new name>```: Rename the layer (or layers) modified by a command;
* [```-each <expression>```](https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper/wiki/Command-Reference#-each): Apply a JavaScript &lt;expression&gt; to each feature in a layer. Data properties are available as local variables. Additional feature-level properties 
  are available as read-only properties of the this object.
  E.g.
  ```'geo_code=country_co,geo_label=country_na'```: replace the data in *geo_code* with *country_co* and *geo_label* with *country_na*. Note there must be no 
  spaces due to a bug as of 5/6/2018 (now fixed in development) so the delete example will not work;
* [```-dissolve <fields>```](https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper/wiki/Command-Reference#-dissolve): Aggregate groups of features using a data field, or aggregate all features if no field is given. For polygon layers, -dissolve merges adjacent polygons by 
  erasing shared boundaries. For point layers, -dissolve replaces a group of points with their centroid. For polyline layers, -dissolve tries to merge contiguous polylines into as 
  few polylines as possible.
  &lt;fields&gt; Name of a data field or fields to dissolve on. Accepts a comma-separated list of field names;
* [```-rename-fields <fields>```](https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper/wiki/Command-Reference#-rename-fields): Rename data fields. To rename a field from A to B, use the assignment operator: B=A.
  &lt;fields&gt; or fields= List of fields to rename as a comma-separated list;
* [```-verbose```](https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper/wiki/Command-Reference#-verbose): Print verbose messages, including the time taken by each processing step;
* [```-info```](https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper/wiki/Command-Reference#-info):Print information about a dataset. Useful for seeing the fields in a layer's attribute data table. Also useful for summarizing the result of a series of commands;
* [```-clean```](https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper/wiki/Command-Reference#-clean): Repair overlaps and fill small gaps between adjacent polygons. Only gaps that are completely enclosed can be filled. Areas that are contained by more than one polygon 
  (overlaps) are assigned to the polygon with the largest area. Similarly, gaps are assigned to the largest-area polygon. This rule may give undesired results and will likely change 
  in the future.

### 2.4.5 Dissolving a shapefile

To dissolve a geography - UK regions (GOR2011) to UK Countries. 

Step 1: Edit the DBF file using QGIS to add *country_co* and *country_na* as follows. This provides the correct code to dissolve onto. This possibly could be done 
programatically using *mapshaper*.

To dump DBF to CSV: ```C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\npm\mapshaper.cmd -i Region\*.shp -o Region\region11_clip.csv format=csv -verbose```:

Old DBF file data:

| GOR2011   | GOR_NAME                 | EER11CDO |
|-----------|--------------------------|----------|
| E12000006 | East of England          |          | 
| E12000003 | Yorkshire and The Humber |          | 
| E12000008 | South East               |          | 
| E12000004 | East Midlands            |          | 
| E12000007 | London                   |          | 
| E12000009 | South West               |          | 
| E12000005 | West Midlands            |          | 
| E12000002 | North West               |          | 
| E12000001 | North East               |          | 
| W08000001 | Wales                    | 10       | 
| S15000001 | Scotland                 | 11       | 

New DBF file data:

| GOR2011   | GOR_NAME                 | EER11CDO | country_co | country_na |
|-----------|--------------------------|----------|------------|------------|
| E12000006 | East of England          |          | E92000001  | England    |
| E12000003 | Yorkshire and The Humber |          | E92000001  | England    |
| E12000008 | South East               |          | E92000001  | England    |
| E12000004 | East Midlands            |          | E92000001  | England    |
| E12000007 | London                   |          | E92000001  | England    |
| E12000009 | South West               |          | E92000001  | England    |
| E12000005 | West Midlands            |          | E92000001  | England    |
| E12000002 | North West               |          | E92000001  | England    |
| E12000001 | North East               |          | E92000001  | England    |
| W08000001 | Wales                    | 10       | W92000004  | Wales      |

## 2.4 Post Front End Processing

Typical post front end processing:

* Loads tile maker output into both *sahsuland* and *sahsuland_dev* in a non RIF40 Schema. This can be any 
  database;
* Processes *sahsuland_dev* schema to tiles;
* Loads production data into the *rif40* schema on both *sahsuland* and *sahsuland_dev*.

The SEER pre-processing script *pg_load_seer_covariates.sql* has a dependency on the *cb_2014_us_nation_5m*, 
*cb_2014_us_state_500k* and *cb_2014_us_county_500l* that are part of the 
*tile maker* pre-processing. The FIPS code is required to make the join and this field is not in the standard 
lookup tables. For this reason it is necessary to build 
the covariates table on *sahsuland_dev*. In the longer term the FIPS codes should be added to the lookup tables. 

### 2.4.1 Geospatial Data Load

1. Place the files in the archive *data* in a new directory together with the *geoDataLoader.xml* configuration 
   file
2. Load data into a non RIF40 Schema:
   - Postgres: ```psql -U <username> -d <database name> -w -e -f pg_USA_2014.sql```
     Flags:
     * ```-U <username>```: connect as user &lt;username&gt; **NOT** *rif40*;
     * ```-d <database name>```: connect to database &lt;database name&gt;
     * ```-w```: never issue a password prompt. If the server requires password authentication and a password is not available by other means 
       such as a .pgpass file, the connection attempt will fail;
     * ```-e```: copy all SQL commands sent to the server to standard output as well;
     * ```-f pg_USA_2014.sql```: run SQL script pg_USA_2014.sql
  
     For information on [Postgres passwords](https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility/blob/master/rifDatabase/databaseManagementManual.md#221-postgres)

     E.g: ```psql -U peter -d sahsuland_dev -w -e -f pg_USA_2014.sql```

	[Postgres data processing example log](https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility/blob/master/rifNodeServices/postgres_data_processing.md)
	
   - SQL Server: ```sqlcmd -U <username> -P <password> -d <database name> -b -m-1 -e -r1 -i mssql_USA_2014.sql  -v pwd="%cd%"```
     Flags:
     * ```-U <username>```: connect as user &lt;username&gt; **NOT** *rif40*;
     * ```-P <password>```: the &lt;password&gt; for user &lt;username&gt;;
     * ```-d <database name>```: connect to database &lt;database name&gt;;
     * ```-b```: terminate batch job if there is an error;
     * ```-m-1```: all messages including informational messages, are sent to stdout;
     * ```-e```: echo input;
     * ```-r1```: redirects the error message output to stderr;
     * ```-i mssql_USA_2014.sql```: run SQL script mssql_USA_2014.sql;
     * ```-v pwd="%cd%"```: set script variable pwd to %cd% (current working directory). So bulk 
       load can find the CSV files.
	
	E.g:
	```sqlcmd -U peter -P XXXXXXXXXXX -d sahsuland_dev -b -m-1 -e -r1 -i mssql_USA_2014.sql  -v pwd="%cd%"```

Data loading steps. These load the data and prepare it for tile manufacture:
	
* For each shapefile geolevel:
  * Create the table, comment;
  * Load data;
  * check rows;  
  * Add primary key;
  * Add geometry columns (1/geolevel + the original shapefile geometry), geographic centroid column;
  * Update geographic centroid, geometry columns, handle polygons and mutlipolygons,
    convert highest zoomlevel to original;
	- Postgres
	  ```SQL
	  UPDATE cb_2014_us_county_500k
	   SET geographic_centroid = ST_GeomFromText(geographic_centroid_wkt, 4326),

  This is a key SQL statement and the code (tile_intersects_insert2.sql) is markedly different although functionally identical between SQL Server and Postgres. For
  performance reasons the SQL Server code is split into sub statements to prevent SQL Server ignoring the common table expression structure and unnesting.
  The algorithm only processes NON NULL tiles (i.e.e tiles with data in them). This results in the following savings:
  ```
    1> SELECT geolevel_id, zoomlevel,
	2>        COUNT(DISTINCT(areaid)) AS areas,
	3>        MIN(x) AS xmin, MIN(y) AS ymin,
	4>        MAX(x) AS xmax, MAX(y) AS ymax,
	5>    (MAX(x)-MIN(x)+1)*(MAX(y)-MIN(y)+1) AS possible_tiles,
	6>        COUNT(DISTINCT(CAST(x AS VARCHAR) + CAST(y AS VARCHAR))) AS tiles,
	7>    CAST(ROUND((CAST( (((MAX(x)-MIN(x)+1)*(MAX(y)-MIN(y)+1)) /* possible_tiles */ - COUNT(DISTINCT(CAST(x AS VARCHAR) + CAST(y AS VARCHAR)))) AS NUMERIC)/

### 2.4.2 Tile Manufacture

In the same directory as before run the *tile Maker* manufacturer. This has separate Postgres and SQL Server stubs calling a common 
*tileMaker.js* node.js core:

* ```node <node options> <full path to script> <flags>```

  Where the flags are:
  * ```-D, --database  <database name>```: Name of the database.          
    [default: <user default>];
  * ```-U, --username <username>```: Connect as user &lt;username&gt; **NOT** *rif40*.         
    [default: NONE (use MSSQL trusted connection/psql style default)];
  * ```--password, --pw <password>```: The &lt;password&gt; for user &lt;username&gt;
  * ```-H, --hostname```: &lt;hostname&gt; of the database. 
    [default: "localhost"];
  * ```-V, --verbose```: Verbose mode. 
    [default: 0: false; 1 or 2];
  * ```-X, --xmlfile <XML file>```: XML Configuration file &lt;XML file&gt;.
    [default: "geoDataLoader.xml"];
  * ```-p, --pngfile```: Make SVG/PNG files.                     
    [default: false]
  * ```-h, --help```: display this helpful message and exit.
    [default: false]
	   
  Node options example:
  * Node *Node.js* executable options, e.g. ```--max-old-space-size=<max node memory in MB>``` 
	
Script examples:
	   
* Postgres: ```node C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\GitHub\rapidInquiryFacility\rifNodeServices\pgTileMaker.js --database sahsuland_dev```
  [Postgres tile manufacture example log](https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility/blob/master/rifNodeServices/postgres_tile_manufacture.md)
  A log file will be created in the current directory as: *pgTileMaker.log*;
* SQL Server: ```node C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\GitHub\rapidInquiryFacility\rifNodeServices\mssqlTileMaker.js -U peter --password XXXXXXXXXXX --database sahsuland_dev```
  [SQL Server tile manufacture example log](https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility/blob/master/rifNodeServices/sql_server_tile_manufacture.md)
  A log file will be created in the current directory as: *mssqlTileMaker.log*

The CSV Files are created in a) the XML: directory defined in *geoDataLoader.xml* if the directory exists or b) the current working directory if it does not. 
```
Creating hierarchy CSV file: C:/Users/phamb/AppData/Local/Temp/shpConvert/c01a6d67-dd9d-4380-9446-21470eafdcfd/data/pg_hierarchy_ews2011.csv for EWS2011: England, Wales and Scotland 2011 census Administatrive geography
```

Tile manufacturing steps:
  
* Parse XML configuration file;
* Connect to database;
* Create hierarchy CSV file;
* Create lookup CSV file for each geolevel;
* Create adjacency CSV file for geography;
* Create geometry CSV file for geography;
* Create tiles 10 at a time for each zoomlevel and geography:
  * Tile IDs are in the form ```<geolevel_id>_<zoomlevel>_<x>_<y>```;
  * Tiles are processed by geolevel and  zoomlevel in blocks of 10 in x/y order. SQL Server code to create the tile blocks table:
    ```SQL
	IF OBJECT_ID('tile_blocks_usa_2014', 'U') IS NOT NULL DROP TABLE tile_blocks_usa_2014;
	WITH a AS (
		SELECT geolevel_id, zoomlevel, x, y, COUNT(areaid) AS total_areas
		  FROM  tile_intersects_usa_2014
		GROUP BY geolevel_id, zoomlevel, x, y
	), b AS (
		SELECT geolevel_id, zoomlevel, x, y, total_areas,
			   ABS((ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY geolevel_id, zoomlevel ORDER BY x, y))/10)+1 AS block
		  FROM a
	), c AS (
	SELECT geolevel_id, zoomlevel, block, x, y, total_areas,
		   CAST(geolevel_id AS VARCHAR) + '_' + CAST(zoomlevel AS VARCHAR) + '_' + CAST(x AS VARCHAR) + '_' + CAST(y AS VARCHAR) AS tile
	  FROM b
	)
	SELECT geolevel_id, zoomlevel, block, x, y, total_areas, tile
	  INTO tile_blocks_usa_2014
	  FROM c
	 ORDER BY geolevel_id, zoomlevel, block, tile;
    ```	
  * The tile blocks, intersects and lookup tables are then joined (e.g. tile_blocks_usa_2014 y, tile_intersects_usa_2014 z, lookup_cb_2014_us_nation_5m) and the area_id's for each tile
    appended in a single ```FeatureCollection``` for the tile, see [GeoJSON draft version 6](http://wiki.geojson.org/GeoJSON_draft_version_6). Example SQL Server SQL:
    ```SQL
		WITH a AS (
			SELECT CAST(z.geolevel_id AS VARCHAR) + '_' + 'CB_2014_US_NATION_5M' + '_' + CAST(z.zoomlevel AS VARCHAR) + '_' + CAST(z.x AS VARCHAR) + '_' + CAST(z.y AS VARCHAR) AS tile_id,
				 z.geolevel_id, z.zoomlevel, z.geom.STAsText() AS optimised_wkt, z.areaid, z.x, z.y, y.block,
				 a.gid AS lookup_gid, a.*
			 FROM tile_blocks_usa_2014 y, tile_intersects_USA_2014 z, lookup_CB_2014_US_NATION_5M a
			 WHERE y.geolevel_id = @geolevel_id
			   AND y.zoomlevel   = @zoomlevel
			   AND y.block       = @block
			   AND y.geolevel_id = z.geolevel_id
			   AND y.zoomlevel   = z.zoomlevel
			   AND y.x           = z.x
			   AND y.y           = z.y
			   AND z.areaid      = a.CB_2014_US_NATION_5M
		)
		SELECT tile_id, areaid, geolevel_id, zoomlevel, x, y, block,
			   areaname, CB_2014_US_NATION_5M, geographic_centroid, optimised_wkt, lookup_gid
			   FROM a
		 ORDER BY tile_id, areaid;
	```
	This GeoJSON is then converted to [TopoJSON](https://github.com/topojson/topojson-specification/blob/master/README.md) and stored in the tiles table.

### 2.4.3 Load Production Data into the RIF

1. Load production data into RIF40 Schema.
   - Postgres: ```psql -U rif40 -d <database name> -w -e -f rif_pg_usa_2014.sql```
     Flags:
     * ```-U rif40```: connect as *rif40*;
     * ```-d <database name>```: connect to database &lt;database name&gt;
     * ```-w```: never issue a password prompt. If the server requires password authentication and a password is not available by other means 
       such as a .pgpass file, the connection attempt will fail;
     * ```-e```: copy all SQL commands sent to the server to standard output as well;
     * ```-f rif_pg_usa_2014.sql```: run SQL script rif_pg_usa_2014.sql
  
     For information on [Postgres passwords](https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility/blob/master/rifDatabase/databaseManagementManual.md#221-postgres)

     E.g: ```psql -U rif40 -d sahsuland -w -e -f rif_pg_usa_2014.sql```
	 
	[Postgres production data load log](https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility/blob/master/rifNodeServices/postgres_load.md)
	 
   - SQL Server: ```sqlcmd -U rif40 -P <password> -d <database name> -b -m-1 -e -r1 -i rif_mssql_usa_2014.sql  -v pwd="%cd%"```
     Flags:
     * ```-U rif40```: connect as *rif40*;
     * ```-P <password>```: the &lt;password&gt; for user *rif40*;
     * ```-d <database name>```: connect to database &lt;database name&gt;;
     * ```-b```: terminate batch job if there is an error;
     * ```-m-1```: all messages including informational messages, are sent to stdout;
     * ```-e```: echo input;
     * ```-r1```: redirects the error message output to stderr;
     * ```-i rif_mssql_usa_2014.sql```: run SQL script rif_mssql_usa_2014.sql;
     * ```-v pwd="%cd%"```: set script variable pwd to %cd% (current working directory). So bulk 
       load can find the CSV files.
	
	E.g:
	```sqlcmd -U rif40 -P XXXXXXXXXXX -d sahsuland -b -m-1 -e -r1 -i rif_mssql_USA_2014.sql  -v pwd="%cd%"```

 	[SQL Server production load example log](https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility/blob/master/rifNodeServices/sql_server_load.md)
	
  - To Reload the geography it must not be in use by any studies:
    ```
    psql:rif_pg_usa_2014.sql:151: ERROR:  Geography: USA_2014 is used by: 2 studies
    ```
  
Load processed geometry and tiles tables into production database:
     
a) Integrate new geography with RIF40 control tables, i.e. add the data in:                   
   * *geography_usa_2014*;                               
   * *geolevels_usa_2014*;     
   to be respective RIF40 tables *rif40_geographies* and *rif40_geolevels*;
b) Add processed geometry data (partitioned in PostGres), e.g:                          
   * *geometry_usa_2014*;                                 
c) Create hierarchy table, e.g: 
   * *hierarchy_usa_2014*;   
d) Create lookup tables, e.g:
   * *lookup_cb_2014_us_county_500k*;             
   * *lookup_cb_2014_us_nation_5m*;                    
   * *lookup_cb_2014_us_state_500k*;      
e) Tiles table and view               
   * *t_tiles_usa_2014*           
   * *tiles_usa_2014*;                                
f) Create adjacency table, e.g: 
   * *adjacency_usa_2014*   
	
2. Test the RIF is setup correctly:
	
- Check the *rif40_geographies* table;
- Check the *rfi40_geolevels* view;
- Check geography is selectable in the initial study submission screen;

Add data, then:

- Check study and comparison area selection works OK;
- Setup and run a study.

# 3. TileMaker Source Code

TO BE ADDED.

## 3.1 TileMaker Server

### 3.1.1 TileMaker SQL Generation

## 3.2 TileMaker Web Application

## 3.3 TileViewer

The TileViewer is an experimental program to view tiles and to test the topoJSON technology used in the RIF. It also uses tile caching technology not enabled in the RIF web front end
so may have browser compatibility issues. It currently uses both Postgres and SQL Server; both must be used for it to run.

To use the *tileViwer* you must

* Load your geography into your default database on **BOTH** SQL Server and Postgres.
* Set the SQL Server password in *rapidInquiryFacility\rifNodeServices\lib\tileViewer.js*:
  ```
				var config = {
					driver: 	'msnodesqlv8',
					user: 		'peter',				// Hard coded. Will change
					password: 	'retep',
					server: 	p_hostname,
					database: 	p_database,
					options: {
  //					trustedConnection: true,		// Will be an option
						useUTC: true,
						appName: 'tileViewer.js'
					}
				};
  ```

# 4. TileMaker TODO

TileMaker is currently working with some minor faults but needs to have in order of priority:

1. Make ZIP file download work. A workaround is provided;
2. Using lower case DBF file names will result in a crash;
3. Needs to calculate geographic centroids using the database;
4. Support for population weighted centroids]. In the interim this will be supported via script;
5. UTF8/16 support (e.g. Slättåkra-Kvibille should not be mangled as at present);
6. Support very large shapefiles (e.g. COA2011). This probably will require a rewrite of the shapefile reader to process area by area. The issue is with multipolygons. 
   These are often multiple records in shapefiles and they need to be UNIOONed together. A workaround is provide in 
   [2.4 Pre Processing Shapefiles](https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility/blob/master/rifNodeServices/tileMaker.md#24-pre-processing-shapefiles);
7. GUI's needs to be merged and brought up to same standard as the rest of the RIF. The TileViewer screen is in better shape
   than the TileMaker screen. Probably the best solution is to use Angular;
8. Add all DBF fields in shapefile to lookup table (i..e add FIPS codes);
9. Support for database logon in the front end;
10. Run the generated scripts in the Node.js server. This requires the ability to logon and PSQL copy needs to be replaced to SQL COPY from STDIN/to STDOUT with STDIN/STOUT
    file handlers in Node.js.
