# Windows installation notes

Postgres is best downloaded from Enterprise DB: http://www.enterprisedb.com/products-services-training/pgdownload. 
The Postgres installer then runs stack builder to download and install the additional packages. The following additional packages need to be installed:

* PostGres (database, PG Admin III administration tool, and common extensions)
* PostGIS (Geospatial integration)
* PostGIS (Geospatial integration)
* pgJDBC (Java database connector for PostGres)

The following are optional:

* pgAgent (batch engine)
* pgBouncer (load balancer; for use if you have a synchronous or near synchronous replica database)
* pgODBC (ODBC database connector for PostGres)
