#SQL Server Port

**Version1_RH_2014** contains all the code needed to generate the basic RIF40 SQL Server database developed by Raunaque Hasnat in 2014.  Most of the SQL code in the directory is machine-generated by Microsoft tools.  She created the main tables and some of the tables' triggers and views in the main rif40 schema, although all the objects were created in the default dbo schema. 

**sahsuland_dev** contains all the new code written from April 2015 onwards to create the full database for the RIF.  The objects are organized in schemas like the Postgres version of the sahsuland_dev database.  Raunaque's code is the starting point, although it has been edited to fit into the new database structure, and Peter's Postgres database is the goal that we are working towards. 

**installation** contains code and notes on how to set up the SQL Server environment and run the database creation scripts.
