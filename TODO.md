# Java Middleware

1.	Note that Kevin Garwood was the lead Java developer who left in March 2017. Since then there has not been a full-time Java developer 
    working on the RIF.

	Note: new lead Java developer (Martin  McCallion) to start on the 5th March 2018.
	
2.	DataStorageLayer is split into ms and pg. All web services have either /ms or /pg in the URL to signify which database is being used.
    This needs to be refactored into a common super class for both databases and dispense of the two separate lumps of code for each 
	database type. The actual differences between ms and pg are not very big. The RIF works the way things are now, but there is a lot 
	of duplication of code and it will cause a huge maintenance problem in the future.

	See: [Creating a new restful web service](https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility/wiki/Creating-a-new-restful-web-service)
	for examples of this and a discussion of the solutions.
	
	A partial solution has been implemented for the ZIP and extract services as a proof of concept. Common SQL code
	with port specific differences has been implmented.
	
3.	The R script uses ODBC. Now that JRI is used this can be changed to JDBC to allow Linux version of RIF. The JRI code has now been 
    isolated into RIF_odbc.R proior to conversion.

4.	Improved logging. [PH done September 2017]; including correct error recovery tracing. Note there are issues with
    log4j log rotation.

5.	Still A LOT of redundant, dead-end, stubbed, duplicate or unused code resulting from the lack of initial scoping as to what the RIF 
    was going to do.

6.	Risk Analysis: The Front-end can supply the following to the middleware as part of the JSON submission posted as submitStudy:
	type = 'risk_analysis_study';
	```
            areaType = 'risk_analysis_study_area';
	```
	OR
	```
            type = "disease_mapping_study";
            areaType = "disease_mapping_study_area";
	```
	
	Depending on the study type selected by the user. Currently, only disease mapping will 	work. If you attempt to submit risk_analysis you will get an error. This lump of JSON is read 	by the middleware as getRIFSubmissionFromJSONSource(inputStream).

	Also, each map area has a band attribute (for disease mapping this is not expected by the middleware and is not used (Sequential and unique band IDs are assigned in the database by 	Peter). For risk analysis, the bands assigned by the user in the front-end must be used.

	```"map_areas":{"map_area":[{"id":"01.008","gid":8,"label":"01.008","band":1}]}```

	THERE IS NOTHING IN THE MIDDLEWARE/R TO HANDLE RISK ANALYSIS (at least I don't think so). The Database is 
	believed to be complete an the middleware should be able to parse the JSON without too much restructuring.

	There exists a class 'DiseaseMappingStudy' this will probably form the basis of a risk 	mapping study processing via runStudyThread. 
	Either by incorporating risk analysis into this class, or duplicating the class, renaming to RiskAnalysisStudy and adjusting to 
	handle risk analysis. Note that the type of the study is not known until it is parsed so the abstrst class will need
    to identify the study type and have an appropriate getStudyType() method	

	The best possible outcome here is that we just have to keep the diseaseMappingStudy class as it is (assuming that the extract table 
	for disease mapping and risk analysis can be the same). Then, within this class there is some kind of switch that just sets of a 
	different R script to run risk analysis.

	Anna FS is tasked to write the associated R script to do risk analysis. This will be run in the RIF using JRI as is the disease 
	mapping Bayesian INLA R script.

7.  Data Extract ZIP file. PH completed initial middleware support. The middleware export functionality will 
    shortly be modified to: [Done PH]

    * Use numbered directories (1-100 etc) to reduce the number of files/directories per directory to 100. This is to improve filesystem 
	  performance on Windows Tomcat servers [Done];
	* Generate the study setup JSON used by the web browser [this will need the missing database fields to be added, principally smoothing type].
	  This **MUST** be exactly the same information as generated by the front end!
	* Generate GeoJSON for mapping. This will include the result data which will need to be flattened (e.g. relative_risk_males_no_covariates);
	* Add support for runing R scripts pre zip file creation. This is to add maps using the map setup choosen by the user in the mapping dashboard.
	  The intention in to support all the potential map options like the last RIF, and also add the D3 graphics: population pyramids...
	
8.  Rengine not being shutdown correctly on reload of service:
    ```
    Cannot find JRI native library!
    Please make sure that the JRI native library is in a directory listed in java.library.path.

    java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Native Library C:\Program Files\R\R-3.4.0\library\rJava\jri\x64\jri.dll already loaded in another classloader
        at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadLibrary0(Unknown Source)

        at rifServices.dataStorageLayer.pg.PGSQLAbstractRIFStudySubmissionService.submitStudy(PGSQLAbstractRIFStudySubmissionService
    ```
    The solution is to restart tomcat. Server reload needs to stop R. This requires a ```@WebListener 
	[Context Listener (javax.servlet.ServletContextListener)]```.

9.  Log4j logging is not flushing new logs on day turn.
	
# JavaScript

1.	Code mostly works - may need some tidying in places

2.	Export map to png functionality. This is very difficult to implement as it is not really supported in Leaflet and in all browsers. 
    In reality, this functionality may have to be removed. The user can download the data to import into a GIS anyway. Another option 
	would be to recommend the use of making the map full screen then using the Print Scrn button to copy to clipboard. Same goes for the 
	export D3 to png code. This sort of works, but does not work at all in IE, but right click save works. Needs looking at or maybe 
	removing functionality.

	PH suggestion: this may be best done in R. Will probably need a shapefile with the results in it. Proof of concept rifMapping.R script
	in progress; awaiting data. [Done PH using Java]
	
3.	Save rifSubmission to text file (.JSON). This is currently done with a directive in JS and as such is a bit temperamental because of 
    various browser/security issues. We need a new middleware method to save the rifSubmission.txt as a 
	.json file [see above]. [Done PH - implmented using middleware]

4.	Some of the references to parent and child scopes are messy and non-angular and may need looking at. But it does work. 

5.	Adapt front-end (investigation) to accept multiple covariates (database cannot this yet, but should in future). Change drop-down to 
    a check-box list.

6.	Adapt front-end (investigation) to accept multiple investigations (database cannot this yet, but should in future).

7.	Possible refactor the submission mapping tools (rifd-dsub-maptable) to fit in with the Leaflet stuff used in disease mapping and data 
    viewer as there is a lot of duplication. It works fine as it is though, just a maintenance issue.

8.	Main CSS needs removal of redundant code

9.	At some point, Leaflet version used will need to be updated to v1.2.x. Breaking changes to the RIF expected.

10.	New D3 output graphs as-and-when requested by users. It is likely that when risk analysis is done, new graphs and/or tables will be 
    needed.
	
11. A download link is required to download the actual ZIP file [this requires a Middleware method too!] [Done PH. Is intelligent]

12. When you change the geography the numerator and denominator do not change and need to be 
    changed manually; [Done; bug fix]
	
13. Login initialisation errors if a) you shoot tomcat whilst logged on [the RIF must be reloaded]
    and b) spurious complaints caused by the process of logging out; e.g.
	```
	ERROR: API method "isLoggedIn" has a null "userID" parameter.
	ERROR: Record "User" field "User ID" cannot be empty.
	```
	
    Normally reloading the RIF allows the user to logon again; although if the user is already logged on 
    the Middleware will not let the user log on a second time; [Done: 29/3/2018 PH]
	
14. The newest study completed when the RIF initialised is displayed, this does not change with even when 
    the user goes to the tab for the first time;

15.	Add save study/comparison bands to file. Upload from file must have fields named ID,Band and can have 
    other fields (e.g. NAME). Names are restricted and a save to file option would be good. 
    File: rifd-dsub-maptable.js;
	
16. Map synchronisation issues: [Done: PH 18/12/2017]
	* A change in geography from one study to another causes chaos in the data viewer and disease 
	  mapping tabs. The best solution is to set both tabs to the same geography then set up the maps
	  and finally zoom to map extent. This will fix the map to the correct location;
	* Chrome is the worst browser and often does not refresh unless the map setup is reapplied;
	* Needs caching (i.e. the middleware slowes it down). This is particularily noticeable on 
	  slow systems;
	  
17. The map hover displays the *area_id* prperty and should also display the *name* property if it is available [Done: 7/11/2017];

18. Null zoomlevel error, appears when moving between the data viewer and the disease mapper. Made much more
    likely by changing from one geography to another! [Done: PH 18/12/2017]
	```
	11:58:59.708 XML Parsing Error: no element found
	Location: https://localhost:8080/rifServices/studyResultRetrieval/ms/getTileMakerTiles?userID=peter&geographyName=USA_2014&geoLevelSelectName=CB_2014_US_COUNTY_500K&zoomlevel=null&x=1&y=0
	Line Number 1, Column 1: 1 getTileMakerTiles:1:1
	```  
	
    Appears to stop the "zoom" to map and then to study extent;
	
19. Memory leaks [Done: PH 18/12/2017]

	* Layer orphan issues (fixed temporarily by removing the layer):
	  ```
		if (mapID === undefined) { // Occurs only on SQL Server!
	  //							  Do nothing!						
			$scope.consoleError("Null mapID; layer options: " + JSON.stringify(layer.options, null, 2));
			if (layer !== undefined) {
				layer.remove(); 	// Remove 
			}
		}
	  ```
	  
	  This appears to only occur in SQL Server; this is probably because the SQL Server 
	  code is faster.
	  This has dealt with the symptoms, **not the cause**. The direct cause is the layer add 
	  function is being called before the map has initialised properly. Taken with the 
	  *Null zoomlevel error* there is a synchronisation bug in the leaflet code. This issue
	  was experienced with the TileMaker code and the fix - stronger asynchronous control is 
	  the same (i.e do not rely on Leaflet to do it all). This will have the effect of 
	  some counties not being displayed (say 40/3233).
	* Some work is still needed on memory leaks (objects never going out of scope). 
	  Disease mapping is leaking badly (3GB/hour) doing nothing when displaying a large US 
	  study. The data viewer population pyramid also has a one off leak every time you change 
	  the year. Logging off does not release resources so maps are not being destroyed on 
	  logoff (other events will need to be checked). Almost certainly related to the above.
	* Memory leak analysis in Firefox shows the function *link()* in the Angular directive 
	  *rifd-dmap-d3rrzoom.js* (SVG relative risk maps) is responsible for about 7% of the leaks, 
	  the 93% of the leaks have no stack available;
	* Memory leak analysis in Chrome is by object, not by stack but shows that:
	  * Function *resetTable()* in *rifc-dsub-params.js* is leaking
		```  
			resetTable = function () {
				$scope.thisICDselection.length = 0; // This causes a leak!
				// $scope.thisICDselection.splice(0, $scope.thisICDselection.length);
					// A fix
			};
		```
		
		This may be a Chrome specific bug; as the original code **should** work. It is 
		a widespread problem in the code; e.g. *clearTheMapOnError(mapID)* in 
		*rifc-util-mapping.js*; and more testing is needed to determine if this really causes 
		a leak! 60 javascript files were found to contain the string ```.length=```.
	  * Lots of *_map()* objects leaking re-inforcing the above observations
	  * SVG related leaks as seen above.
	* Leak actual caused by $watch synchronmisation in disease mapping D3 graphs. This was redrawing 
	  the graphs several times per second! The actual leak was not fixed since it is small. The omly conclusion is to avoid
	  overly complex directives as self modification will cause a re-run! 
	* Code was restructured to remove mal-synchronisation issues and to parallelise tile and data fetching
	  
# Database

## Missing information not stored in the database

1.	Retrieve information on a completed study. Used in the info button in disease mapping and data viewer. 
    The database cannot return all the required information. This requires changes to both the backend and 
	middleware. [Planned PH]

2.	I'm not sure the statistical method is being stored in the database correctly, that is it is always NONE. 
    [Done PH]

## Postgres Port

1. The Postgres port is slow. This is because by the logging function *rif40_log()* is not compiled in Postgres and therefore slow. Needs to 
   either be made acceptablely fast or the debug messages commented out. This particularily effects triggers. The Postgres SEER data is also 
   extrscting 3x slower than SQL Server; this requires further analysis; [Done: 13/11/2017]
2. Data loading scripts needs to be made make independent - i.e. run from a single script like the SQL server ones, with one file/object;
3. Patches needs to be merged.

## SEER test dataset

1. A large scale test dataset of real data is required for testing. The US County level SEER data was selected. [Done: both ports]

   * Needs to be used as a test dataset for the data loader
   * Manual data loading and required data format and cleaning need to be specified
   
   The SEER cancer data has 9,176,963 rows and requires 800MB for the data and 1.3GB for the indexes.
   
   The test study *1004 SEER 2000-13 lung cancer HH income mainland states.json*:
   
   * States were chosen so they mapped compactly:
   
     * California
     * Connecticut
     * Georgia
     * Iowa
     * Kentucky
     * Louisiana
     * Michigan
     * New Jersey
     * New Mexico
     * Utah
     * Washington;
	 
   * Years: 2000-2013 (the maximum period available accross these states);
   * Covariate: median head of houshold income, quntilised;
   * Both sexes;
   * All ages;
   * Lung cancer: 
   
     * C33: Malignant neoplasm of trachea
	 * C340: Main bronchus
	 * C342: Middle lobe, bronchus or lung
	 * C341: Upper lobe, bronchus or lung
	 * C343: Lower lobe, bronchus or lung
	 * C348: Overlapping lesion of bronchus and lung
	 * C349: Bronchus or lung, unspecified
	 
   * Full Bayesian smoothing
   
   Data is extracted SQL server in 35s and R INLA in 40s.

# Security Testing  [Done: PH 24/11/2017]

205 unique URLs were tested using OWASP ZAP (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project) Ajax Spider

The report is at: https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility/blob/master/Testing/owasp_zap_test1.md and the URL list 
tested is at: https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility/blob/master/Testing/url_list2.txt. 

One medium and three low medium isses were highlighted for fixing.

## Medium Issues

1. X-Frame-Options Header Not Set

   X-Frame-Options header is not included in the HTTP response to protect against 'ClickJacking' attacks.

### Solution

* Most modern Web browsers support the X-Frame-Options HTTP header. Ensure it's set on all web pages returned by your site (if you expect the 
  page to be framed only by pages on your server (e.g. it's part of a FRAMESET) then you'll want to use SAMEORIGIN, otherwise if you never expect 
  the page to be framed, you should use DENY. ALLOW-FROM allows specific websites to frame the web page in supported web browsers).
  
### References

* http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/archive/2010/03/30/combating-clickjacking-with-x-frame-options.aspx

## Low Medium Issues

1. Incomplete or No Cache-control and Pragma HTTP Header Set

   The cache-control and pragma HTTP header have not been set properly or are missing allowing the browser and proxies to cache content.

### Solution

* Whenever possible ensure the cache-control HTTP header is set with no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate; and that the pragma HTTP header is set 
  with no-cache.
  
### Reference

* https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet#Web_Content_Caching

2. X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing

   The Anti-MIME-Sniffing header X-Content-Type-Options was not set to 'nosniff'. This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome 
   to perform MIME-sniffing on the response body, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a content type other 
   than the declared content type. Current (early 2014) and legacy versions of Firefox will use the declared content type (if one is set), 
   rather than performing MIME-sniffing.

### Solution

* Ensure that the application/web server sets the Content-Type header appropriately, and that it sets the X-Content-Type-Options header to 
  'nosniff' for all web pages.</p><p>If possible, ensure that the end user uses a standards-compliant and modern web browser that does not 
  perform MIME-sniffing at all, or that can be directed by the web application/web server to not perform MIME-sniffing.
  
### Other information

* This issue still applies to error type pages (401, 403, 500, etc) as those pages are often still affected by injection issues, in which case 
  there is still concern for browsers sniffing pages away from their actual content type.</p><p>At "High" threshold this scanner will not 
  alert on client or server error responses.

* https://www.owasp.org/index.php/List_of_useful_HTTP_headers

3. Web Browser XSS Protection Not Enabled

   Web Browser XSS Protection is not enabled, or is disabled by the configuration of the 'X-XSS-Protection' HTTP response header 
   on the web server

### Solution

* Ensure that the web browser's XSS filter is enabled, by setting the X-XSS-Protection HTTP response header to '1'.
  
### Other information

* The X-XSS-Protection HTTP response header allows the web server to enable or disable the web browser's XSS protection mechanism. 
  The following values would attempt to enable it: 
  
  * X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
  * X-XSS-Protection: 1; report=http://www.example.com/xss
  
  The following values would disable it:
  
  * X-XSS-Protection: 0
  
  The X-XSS-Protection HTTP response header is currently supported on Internet Explorer, Chrome and Safari (WebKit). Note that this 
  alert is only raised if the response body could potentially contain an XSS payload (with a text-based content type, with a 
  non-zero length).

# TileMaker and TileViewer

TileMaker is currently working with some minor faults but needs to:

1. Support for geogrpahic centroids];
2. Run the generated scripts. This requires the ability to logon and PSQL copy needs to be replaced to SQL COPY from STDIN/to STDOUT with STDIN/STOUT
   file handlers in Node.js;
3. UTF8/16 support (e.g. Slättåkra-Kvibille should not be mangled as at present);
4. Support very large shapefiles (e.g. COA2011);
5. Needs a manual!
6. GUI's needs to be merged and brought up to same standard as the rest of the RIF. The TileViewer screen is in better shape
   than the TileMaker screen. Probably the best solution is to use Angular;
7. Support for database logons;
8. Needs to calculate geographic centroids using the database.

# Information Governance Tool

Needs to be specified.

# Data Loading Tool

Needs to be discussed with CDC.
	
# TODO

## Milestones

* April to May 2018: Build SAHSU production system; support CDC in installing RIF
* June to July 2018: Complete risk analysis; test SAHSU production system; add remaining database related 
  functionality:
  * Support for study extract warning messages
  * Remaining data required for study JSON file (areas actually selected by the user)
  * Save and restore map state in the database
* August to September 2018: RIF Handover - Peter Hambly to Martin McCallion; handover SAHSU production 
  system to Hima Daby; add risk analysis to SAHSU production system

### PH Final Deliverables

These are to end of contract 10th October 2018

1.	Laymen installation manual and technical manual for setting up RIF software installation on a new machine by any 
    of the members of the RIF core team (i.e. Martin, Brandon and Fred) – 10th May 2018

    (Instruction to be cross checked on ICL on site computers by SAHSU team before sign off)

2.	Layman method for adding new user login. For both non-secured and secure environment ie private network. Provided as 
    part of the database administrators manual. To be provided in SQL and requires database administration privileges. 
	Automation to be a part of the future information governance tool – May 2018

3.	UK geographies to be added and protocol for adding new geographies to the RIF to be available. Clear documented methods for adding new geographies. – May-June 2018

4.	Straightforward way of adding data to the RIF database. Supply data formatting instructions to the SAHSU data team lead. – June 2018

5.	Disease mapping and risk analysis: the same functionalities as originally included in the RIF 3.2 (except multiple 
    investigations) should be included and working. Having additional functionalities (e.g. SatSCAN) would be good, but if not possible, clear guidance on how to add functionalities should be available. All the functionalities available in the beta-version should have been tested by the end of the contract period (with the support of the RIF team, including Aina and Fred). While Brandon and Martin will have key roles in the development of the risk analysis functionalities, you will oversee the integration into the RIF of the different pieces developed by each of them. – July 2018

6.	ICD codes. Provide protocol for application notes. Will add support to the RIF for using ICD9, 10 and 11 
    simultaneously if time permits – Aug 2018

7.	Confounders. Sex and age defaults. Protocol on how to add and test other cofounders to be made available for the 
    SAHSU team to be able to manage. such as socio-demographic status (Carstairs or IMD), ethnicity or smoking. – Aug 2018

8.	TileMaker and TileViewer: Details of coding and troubleshooting suggestions provided and possible bug fixes. 
    Both to be tested on differing geographies before handover. – Apr-Sep 2018

9.	A complete manual describing the functionalities of the RIF and their use, to be developed with other members of 
    the RIF team, including Brandon, Martin, Aina and Fred. To be kept current. – Apr-Sep 2018

10.	Fully up to date Github repository, with clear annotations and explanations. To be kept current – Apr-Sep 2018

## June to July 2018

### SAHSU RIF [Peter Hambly];

* Test SAHSU production system;
* Handover documentation
* Assist with trial data loading

### Middleware 

* Risk analysis middleware [Martin McCallion];
* Data loader [Martin McCallion]

### Front End [Peter Hambly]

#### High Priority

* Package front end as WAR
* Login screen: focus on user name field: https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility/issues/22
* Able to load, save and run risk analysis studies
* Able to choose continuous covariate variables (not currently supported) https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility/issues/20
  
#### Low Priority

* Save and restore map state in the database;
* Sort popups in data viewer and disease maps [need to discuss]

### Database [Peter Hambly]

#### High Priority

* Add generate_series() to SQL Server port;
* Fix predefined_groiup name issues - should be length 30 in t_rif40_inv_conditions: https://github.com/smallAreaHealthStatisticsUnit/rapidInquiryFacility/issues/21
* Save risk analysis bands as geojson in the database and the save file. Circle may need conversion to geojson (as a polygon of many, many short, linestrings).
* Save selection options (study and comparison resolution and selection geolevels, geolevels selected. Create 
  t_rif40_study_select/rif40_study_select, t_rif40_comparison_select/rif40_comparison_select for areas/bands actually selected by user;
* Add area name to results map table;
  
#### Low Priority

* Add t_rif40_warnings/rif40_warnings to contain warning messages on a study basis. Can be created 
  by extract or R scripts. Add traps for:
  * Out of range or null covariates by year;
  * Missing years of numerator or denominator data;
  * Males/females not present when requested in numerator or denominator; 
  * ICD codes not present when requested in numerator;
  * Maljoin detection
* Add population to map table (max, min, average, rate increase/decrease?), remove join from getAttributes;
* Add viewer/diseasemap[12]_mapping, export_date, last_update_date, comparison_geolevel_select, 
  study_geolevel_select to rif40_studies;
* Add default background layer support for geography (so sahsuland has no background);
* Rename results fields as required;
* Add unique keys to description files on rif tables/projects/health themes to protect against 
  the middleware using them as a Key;

### Front End [Peter Hambly]
	
* Complete generation of the study setup JSON used by the web browser [this will need the missing database fields to be added, principally smoothing 
  type].
  This **MUST** be exactly the same information as generated by the front end!
* Update study and re-generate ZIP file  
* Support for t_rif40_study_select/rif40_study_select, t_rif40_comparison_select/rif40_comparison_select
  for areas/bands actually seleted by user

## August to September 2018

RIF Handover [Peter Hambly]

* Document TileMaker
* Handover to Martin McCallion:
  * Documentation;
  * Front end;
  * Tile maker
* Assist with testing of production RIF system
* Dataloader [Martin McCallion]

# Wish list

This is nice to have functionality that is on hold pending an assessment of need and/or technical feasibility

## Middleware Wish list

* Maps if feasible:
  * Investigate vector grid styling, e.g. grid labels (I don't think it is possible)
  * Get SVG to support layers: http://batik.2283329.n4.nabble.com/Combine-SVG-out-of-single-SVG-files-td3616984.html
* Graphs if feasible:
  * Add support for css <style> tags in jfreechart SVG generator. Also support for rgb to hex 
    conversion for end color when graphic bar renderer used. 
  
## Front End Wish list

* Extend PouchDB to base layer
 
# Issues

These are issues that have been noted but do not affect the running of the RIF

## Middleware Issues

* Logging not rotating properly at end of day. Thought to be caused by log4j threading issues. A simple fix would be to get the 
  taxonomy service to use a separate logger; it may be necessary to replace log4j with SLF4J; Logs will appear 
  if you stop and start the RIF via the catalina scripts. [Fixed: 21/4/2018]

## Front End Issues

* Leaflet sync plugin not panning correctly. Was upgraded to current version as part of leak testing. Will regress and re-test.  
* Choropleth panel: the breaks displayed may not be correct when e.g. changed the number of quantiles will result in zeros!
* Choropleth panel: users can change break points [this could be a feature!]

## Database Issues

* AreaName duplicates to be allowed; key enforcementment to be in the heirarchy table; this allows 
  for duplicate county names within a state
* Change CREATE study to run in own schema; create procedure to transfer study/map tables to correct schema 
  and grant back permissions [i.e. remove security issue with current Postgres code; SQL Server does not have this issue]
* Add t_rif40_study_areas trigger check (once per INSERT/UPDATE) for correct use of band_id in rif40_study_shares. 
  Alternatively check in rif40_run_study
* Rename offset in age_sex_groups (reserved keyword)	
* USA_2014 integration: 
  * RIF40_GEOGRAPHIES set up wrong: default study and comnparison area names use original field name, no setup field names

  This is caused by the wrong setup in rif40_geogrpaphies (i.e. tilemaker)
```
sahsuland=> select * from rif40_geographies;

    Attempt at fix failed (trigger fault) 
```
UPDATE rif40_geographies
   SET defaultcomparea  = 'CB_2014_US_STATE_500K'
 WHERE defaultcomparea  = 'GEOID' AND geography = 'USA_2014';
UPDATE rif40_geographies
   SET defaultstudyarea = 'CB_2014_US_COUNTY_500K'
 WHERE  geography = 'USA_2014';
```
  So the script was fixed, reload needed DELETE FROM rif40_covariates WHERE geography = 'USA_2014' adding.
  This was fixed from before; I appear to have used an older script!
  Also STATE was not a comparison are; this is probably a fault in the scripts. All flags should be set in *rif40_geolevels* 
  Postgres run study middleware code not stopping on error!
* Harden SQL Server port against SQL Injection getting past middleware into meta data
* Disable guest logins on SQL Server

## Data loader Issues

  * TOTAL_FIELD should be total
  * No covariate fields in data table
  * Data loader to generate primary keys. PK on pop_sahsuland_pop_pk + cluster (see: v4_0_create_sahsuland.sql)
  
## Documentation Issues
  
* Add localhost notes to tomcat install doc; add network setup to SQL Server install notes; 
  add notes on cross site scripting errors (caused by URL/webservices name mismatch); firefox example:
  ```
  GET XHR https://peter-pc:8080/rifServices/studySubmission/ms/getDatabaseType?userID=peter [HTTP/1.1 200  25ms]
